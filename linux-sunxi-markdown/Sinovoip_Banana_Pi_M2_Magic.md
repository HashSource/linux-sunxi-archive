# Identification
On the top of the board the BananaPi logo is silkscreened, and next to it: 
[code] 
    BPI_M2M_V1.2
[/code]
There are pictures of a v1.0 PCB version, with small differences, for instance a missing SPI flash footprint. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported in mainline Linux and U-Boot. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][50230] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
Use the _Bananapi_m2m_defconfig_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
Use the _sun8i-r16-bananapi-m2m.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][50231]. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][50235]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][50236].
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][50235].
