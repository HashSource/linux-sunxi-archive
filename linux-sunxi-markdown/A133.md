# Overview
This series of SoCs appears to be targeted towards the mid-range tablet and smart display market, though its higher binned variant, the A133 Plus, has been used in portable retro gaming consoles like the [TRIMUI Smart Pro][2050]. It appears to be similar to the H616 (sun50iw9), with their similar DRAM controller and memory map. See [A133/DRAMC][2051] for more information on the DRAM controller. 
It would overall appear that the A133 is newer than the H616 based on the internal naming (sun50iw9 vs sun50iw10), SOC ID (0x1823 vs 0x1855), and initial user manual release dates (2019/12/28 vs 2020/7/7), though the H616 uses the newer Display Engine 3.0 compared to the A133's DE2.0. This could be explained by the different target markets though, as the H616 was meant for TV boxes and thus would benefit from the 4096x4096 resolution cap. 
# Variants
Originally, there appears to have existed an **Allwinner A100** , which was mentioned in slides provided to some news outlets in 2020[[1]][2052]. There are a small selection of devices which appear to use this base variant; however, the A133 is the name referenced by most available documentation. The reason why the A100 disappeared is unclear; however, there is evidence to support the idea that too many chips met the binning requirements for the A133/R818 and A133 Plus, leading them to retire the A100. This is supported by the difference in OPP tables submitted to mainline in 2020, versus those in vendor leaks. The vendor tables reference 3 separate "bin extensions" in the efuse memroy, each appearing to correlate with the advertised speeds for the A100, A133/R818 (1.6GHz), and A133 Plus (2.0 GHz) respectively. 
There are four known SoC variants, categorized by their binning or target demographic, and one rebadge of the R818. These are: 
  1. **A100** , the lowest bin, with a 1.46 GHz max clock
  2. **A133** , the most common variant, with a 1.6 GHz max clock 
     1. **R818** , a rebadging of the A133, targeted at smart displays
     2. **Creality T800** , a re-rebadging of the R818 used by the [Creality Sonic Pad][2053].
  3. **A133 Plus/A133P** , capability of reaching clock rates of 2.0 GHz
