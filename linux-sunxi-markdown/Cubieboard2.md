# Identification
The board helpfully reads "Cubietech" "Cubieboard.org" and has an A20 chip on it. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
The cubieboard is well represented within the main sunxi developer community and has excellent support both in u-boot as well as 3.4 and mainline kernels. 
## Images

  * [Further android firmwares.][14761]
  * [Ubuntu images.][14762]
  * [Lubuntu images.][14763]
  * [ArchLinuxARM image and installation procedure][14764]

Cubietech also has a bunch of official firmwares available on their [download][14765] page. 
## HW-Pack
Generating a HW pack for the cubieboard2 is easily done with the sunxi-bsp and well supported. 
## BSP
Under the BSP the cubieboard2 is simply known as cubieboard2. Just run: 
[code] 
    ./configure cubieboard2
    make
[/code]
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][14766] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _Cubieboard2_ build target. 
#### Upstream/Mainline U-Boot
Use the _Cubieboard2_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_cubieboard2.fex_][14767] file. 
#### Upstream/Mainline kernel
Use the _sun7i-a20-cubieboard2.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
The only difference between the first version of the [Cubieboard][14737] (with the [A10][14738], mistakenly known as the "original" Cubieboard, but both versions are "original") and the Cubieboard2 (second version with the [A20][14733]) is the SoC itself. The other hardware is _completely_ identical. Because of this many of the [Tips, Tricks, Caveats of the Cubieboard1][14768] regarding the hardware can be applied to the Cubieboard2 as well. 
## FEL mode
The FEL button triggers [ FEL mode][14769]. 
## Machine ID mismatch
There is a difference in the naming of the sun7i platform between the cubieboard2 stock u-boot and the sunxi u-boot. This might cause the kernel to refuse to load, with a message like this: 
[code] 
    Error: unrecognized/unsupported machine ID (r1 = 0x000010bb).
    
    Available machine support:
    
    ID (hex)        NAME
    00000f35        sun7i
    
    Please check your kernel config and/or bootloader.
[/code]
You need to add the following to your [ U-Boot boot.cmd][14770] for the cubieboard stock variant: 
[code] 
    setenv machid 0x00000f35
[/code]
or (for the sunxi variant) 
[code] 
    setenv machid 0x000010bb
[/code]
# Adding a serial port
[![][14771]][14772]
[][14773]
Cubieboard UART pads
There is a nice 2.54mm pin header near to the SoC. All you have to do is connect the correct wires, according to our [UART howto][14774] or the [ Cubieboard TTL howto][14775]. **[![Exclamation-red.png][14776]][14777]Do not connect Vcc as that might damage your board.**

# Also known as
Like the first [Cubieboard][14737], the Cubieboard2 was very popular on its own. Therefor, no rebadging has taken place, but who knows, there might be some bad chinese rip-offs out there, which carry the same name.
