# Identification
On the front of the board, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    H8_HOMLET_PROTO_V2_0
    20141015 L4
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    TEAN-E120399 
    94V-OML1
[/code]
These markings do not have specific significance to the A83T since this is a product verification board. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
There is ongoing discussion at [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/linux-sunxi/_woM2vJmcuc][6433] regarding the mainline support of the SoC in this board. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
The repository at <https://github.com/allwinner-zh/bootloader> contains 
  * BSP for the A83T, <https://github.com/allwinner-zh/bootloader/tree/master/basic_loader/bsp/bsp_for_a83>

## Manual build
  * For building U-Boot, use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][6434]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][6435]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
For [ building mainline U-Boot][6436], use the 'h8_homlet_v2_defconfig' target. 
  

The reference source code from Allwinner is at <https://github.com/allwinner-zh/bootloader> contains 
  * Boot 0 source code for the A83T, <https://github.com/allwinner-zh/bootloader/tree/master/basic_loader/boot0>
  * U-boot 2011.09 for the A83T, <https://github.com/allwinner-zh/bootloader/tree/master/u-boot-2011.09>

## Mainline kernel
Basic support is available in mainline kernel for A83T. 
Use sun8i-a83t-allwinner-h8homlet-v2.dtb device-tree tree binary. 
There is a 3.4 source tree for the A83T at <https://github.com/allwinner-zh/linux-3.4-sunxi/tree/A83T>
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
The following table is a comparison of the A83T SoC to other SoCs from the A-series. 
Module | Description   
---|---  
CPU | Cortex-A7 MP4 in 2 clusters, the MCPM is more likely as the A80   
CCI400 | It's same as the A80   
DRAMM | It's more likely as the A80   
Timer | It's same as the A31 and A20   
CCU | It's more likely as the A80   
DMA | It's same as the A31   
PinCtrl | It's same as the A31   
UART | It's same as the A31 and A20   
RSB | It's same as the A80 and A33   
SPI | It's same as the A31 and A20   
TWI | It's same as the A31 and A20   
NAND | It's more likely as the A80 and A33, but the clk/dma/pin are different   
SD/eMMC | It's same as the A31 and A20   
USB2.0 OTG | It's same as the A31 and A20   
USB HCI | It's same as the A31 and A20   
USB HSIC | It's same as the A80   
GMAC | It's a new IP, is more different of the platform before   
Security Engine | It's same as the A80   
Display Engine | It's a new IP, is more different of the platforms before
