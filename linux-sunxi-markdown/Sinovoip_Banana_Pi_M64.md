# Sinovoip Banana Pi M64
Banana Pi M64 Ultra is a [A64][50662] based development board produced by Sinovoip. 
**Despite its name, the M64 is incompatible to previous Banana Pi boards ([Banana Pi][50663]/[M1][50664]/[M1+][50665]/[Pro][50666]/[M2][50667]/M2+/M3), due to a different SoC - requiring different boot loaders and drivers.** It's another attempt to cash in on the Banana Pi's popularity with a SBC only sharing brand, name, ~~form factor~~ and GPIO header.

# Identification
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    BPi-M64
    v1.0
[/code]
alongside with the BananaPi (Bpi) logo. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
From the software point of view this device is similar to the [Pine64][50693] (similar DRAM, same Ethernet and PMIC), so basic support should work with some Pine64 image. In fact the manufacturer seems to offer Pine64 images based on longsleep's builds.

## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][50694] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **bananapi_m64_defconfig** build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun50i-a64-bananapi-m64.dtb** device-tree binary. 
# Expansion Port
The Banana Pi M64 has the usual 40-pin, 0.1" Raspberry Pi 2 compatible connector with several low-speed interfaces.

Pin PC1, which carries the SPI0-MISO signal, is not available on a header, since it is connected to the eMMC chip. So booting from a SPI flash connected to header pins will not work on the Banana Pi M64. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The FEL button (called U-Boot key in the manual) triggers [ FEL mode][50695]. 
The boot order is: SD card first, then eMMC, then FEL. Pressing the FEL button always triggers FEL mode. A SD card without an eGON header will be skipped, it continues on eMMC then. If boot0 fails to locate U-Boot, it will enter FEL mode. 
## USB
The two type A receptacles are connected to a Terminus Technology Inc. 4-Port hub on the lower PCB side that is connected to the SoC. PCB traces on the board provide a 3rd USB port connected to the hub on solder wholes next to the 40 pin GPIO header ([polarity 'information'][50696]). 
## ESD & over-current protections
Based on the schematic Rev 1.1 (September 18, 2016) the board incorporates the following protections: 
  

Protections x - no protection, ESD - Electrostatic Discharge, OC - Over-current  | Comments   
---|---  
1 | DCIN (power) | x | x | No power supply bypass   
2 | Micro SD | x | x |   
3 | Camera | x | x |   
4 | Dual USB1 | ESD | x |   
5 | Micro USB OTG | ESD | OC | Over-current protection by U8 (unknown value)   
6 | HDMI | ESD | x |   
7 | MIPI-DSI | x | x |   
8 | Ethernet | x | N/A | Over-current protection is not applicable   
9 | GPIO | x | x |   
10 | Debug UART | x | ?   
11 | Audio jack | ESD | N/A | Output current is internally limited by SoC   
# Adding a serial port

Banana Pi M64 UART pads
There is a three pin UART header next to the Ethernet socket, it is connected to UART0. The pins are clearly labelled with GND, RX and TX. Attach a 3.3V UART interface as described in the [UART howto][50700].

From a software point of view there is not much difference from the [Pine64][50693], which is the main development vehicle for the [A64][50662] SoC support. So please check the [Pine64][50693] page for further information.

## Manufacturer images
The official BananaPi M64 page provides already some images, those with Linux based on longsleep's Pine64 images. Be aware that they are based on already outdated BSP kernel/u-boot versions and partially use an ARMv6 userland causing unnecessary performance implications: <http://www.banana-pi.org/m64-download.html>
