# Identification
This section explains how to most easily identify your device. For a development board, explain the name(s) printed on the board. For an android device, find out the strings as reported under settings. The device's exterior is black and does not carry any identification of the manufacturer. 
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: DEVICE
  * Build Number: SOC_BOARD_DEVICE_*.*

The PCB has the following silkscreened nearby the HDMI male connector: 
  * Uhost U1a:

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "uhost_u1a" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [uhost_u1a.fex][51058]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][51059]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
There is a button that might trigger FEL mode.
## USB host port pins
There is a 4 pin header on the mainboard, which seems to be a usb host port. A 2.4GHz wireless module is sometimes plugged there for the "fly mouse". Pin-out is currently unknown. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

DEVICE UART pads
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped.
## Locating the UART
On the backside of the board, there is a group of 4 test pads. RX/TX are bound to be one of those. For more information on finding them, check the [UART howto][51063].
