# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    aoson
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    AL-AX3-751B-V1.0
    2015.03.26
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _M751S-B_
  * Build Number: _aster_ococci-eng 4.4.2 KVT49L 20151008_

It has a Q8-like design, but its buttons are at the same side (left, in the default orientation). 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
None currently, A33 is not supported yet. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][7864] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
  * For building u-boot, use the _q8_a33_tablet_800x480_defconfig_ target.

### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the sun8i-a33-q8-tablet.dtb device-tree binary. 
#### Customized kernel based on Allwinner official SDK
[[1]][7865] includes a customized sdk kernel for m751s along with its config. It requires AOSC OS and its cross-compile toolchain. 
#### BSP Kernel
Use the [aoson_m751s.fex][7866] file. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Vol+ button triggers [ FEL mode][7867]. 
## Device disassembly
It's disassembly is just like Q8 devices. Look for [Format_Q8#Disassembly][7868] for reference. 
Note: Do not start from the side of the screen, otherwise you may break the touchscreen! 
## UART
It seems that no UART pads are available. 
## Interesting things
This pad is claimed to have different SoCs on different websites in China, from RK3288 to A33, and when it's disassembled, the A33 SoC and AXP223 PMIC is covered by stickers. 
## Note about the accessories
The USB-OTG Cable in the device box is too unstable for data transmission. If possible, use another one to replace it.
