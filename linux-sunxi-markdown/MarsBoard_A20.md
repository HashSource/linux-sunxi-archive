The MarsBoard was a short-lived, credit-card sized, extendable board with an Allwinner [A20][35654] SoC. It is an update of the [MarsBoard A10][35658]. 
A new device by the same manufacturer is confusingly also called [Marsboard A20][35659]. It is a completely different design though, with a SOM and a baseboard. This newer board is not documented on this page.

# Identification
The board reads "www.MarsBoard.com" on top, and has an A20 SoC clearly visible. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Only supported by the legacy U-Boot / kernel. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
  * For building u-boot, use the "Marsboard_A20" or "Marsboard_A20_debug" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][35676]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][35677]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
Not currently supported. 
## Mainline kernel
Not currently supported. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
You can install any iso-image for Cubieboard2, for example Armbian. It works fine! 
## FEL mode
A button right next to the SATA connector triggers [ FEL mode][35678]. 
# Adding a serial port
[![][35679]][35680]
[][35681]
240px UART pads
On the P2 header, pins 64, 65 and 66 are ground, TX and RX, respectively. Either solder on some leads, or insert some pins according to our [UART howto][35682]. Be warned though, this is a 2.0mm pitch connector, and not the usual 2.54mm.
