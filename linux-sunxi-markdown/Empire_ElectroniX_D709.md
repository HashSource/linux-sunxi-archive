# Sunxi support
## Current status
U-Boot support [was added in 2015][18022]
A fex file [was written as well][18023]. 
  

## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][18024] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][18025] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The Volume- button triggers [ FEL mode][18026]. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][18030]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][18031].
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][18030].
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][18032], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
