# Identification
A white, credit-card-sized PCB with an A20 chip. "PCDUINO_NANO" is marked on the board to the right of the A20. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Fully supported by the upstream U-Boot and kernel, and the legacy kernel; it's _not_ supported by the legacy U-Boot. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][31446] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Not supported. 
#### Upstream/Mainline U-Boot
Use the _Linksprite_pcDuino3_Nano_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_linksprite_pcduino3_nano.fex_][31447] file. 
#### Upstream/Mainline kernel
Use the _sun7i-a20-pcduino3-nano.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## SATA power connector
The pcDuino3 Nano's SATA power connector uses a JST XH 2.5mm header, and is compatible with the Cubieboard. It's not compatible with the Banana Pi/Pro/M1+ and Orange Pi, where 5V and GND are inverted. 
## FEL mode
The "UBOOT" button triggers [ FEL mode][31448]. 
## Expansion Ports
The pcDuino3 Nano provides Arduino-style 0.1" connectors.

An Arduino breadboard shield that interferes with the USB0 connector
Not all Arduino shields will be compatible with this board, for several reasons: 
  * The GPIOs operate at 3.3V rather than 5V.
  * The analogue input pins on a real Arduino can also be configured as GPIOs; here they can only be inputs.
  * The larger-than-standard PCB size and the position of the UART0 connector means some shields won't physically fit.

# Adding a serial port

## Locating the UARTs
The pcDuino3 Nano provides access to four (and a half) of the A20's UARTs. See the [UART howto][31471] for more details. 
The 3-pin header labelled "UART" sticking out from the side of the board is the A20's UART0. Pin 1 (with a square pad, closest to the IR receiver) is RX, pin 2 is ground, pin 3 is TX. 
UART2, UART5 and UART6 (RX/TX), as well as UART4 (RX only) are available on the Arduino connectors. UART2 is in the standard place for an Arduino UART. 
Note that the labelling in [LinkSprite's diagram][31472] is a bit confusing -- UART2 is described from the A20's point of view but UART0 from the serial cable's point of view, i.e. RX and TX are reversed for UART0.

# Variants
The [pcDuino3 Nano **Lite**][31479] is a version with no flash memory (NAND) and without IR receiver.

## Manufacturer images
The [Ubuntu 14 image that LinkSprite provides][31485] uses a modified linux-sunxi 3.4 kernel. Their patches and build scripts are available [on GitHub][31484]. 
The most important modification is in the GMAC driver, to set the GMAC_TX_DELAY parameter to 3. This adjusts the relative timing of the clock and data signals to the PHY in order to compensate for differing trace lengths on the PCB ([details][31487]; the [Banana Pi][31488] has the same problem). Without this modification, the Ethernet port will work at 100Mbit but not at 1000Mbit. Upstream U-Boot now sets this parameter itself, so the kernel patch isn't needed any more ([patch][31489]). 
In the meantime [Armbian][31490] also supports the pcDuino3 Nano with Debian Wheezy, Jessie or Ubuntu Trusty and with both kernel 3.4.x and 4.1.x (including SoC temp fixes).
