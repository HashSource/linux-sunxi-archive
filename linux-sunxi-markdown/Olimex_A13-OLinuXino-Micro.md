The Olimex A13-OLinuXino-Micro is a shrunk down, cheaper version of the [A13-OLinuXino][40466]. The differences against the A13-OLinuXino are that it has half the ram, a single USB Host port, only u-boot and reset buttons, no RTC, battery connector, NAND or Wifi. As with all [ Olimex Devices][40467] this board is [Open Source Hardware][40468].

# Identification
The board handily reads "A13-OLinuXino-MICRO". 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "A13-OLinuXino-Micro" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [a13-olinuxinom.fex][40486]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][40487]. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the sun5i-a13-olinuxino-micro.dts device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][40488]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The U-Boot button triggers [ FEL mode][40489]. 
## VGA
Even though the [A13][40462] does not provide DACs itself, the A13-Olinuxino has a VGA connector. 
This is implemented through 3 separate DAC chips (NXP LVC244A) which are connected to the LCD0 lines. This in turn means that you cannot use an LCD and a VGA monitor at the same time, but this is ok as the [A13][40462] can only drive one display at a time anyway. 
Due to the bandwidth limitations of the A13 SoC, the best resolution you can hope for is 800x600. 
## LCD modules
You can attach [several Olimex LCD modules][40490] to the [LCD connector (LCD_CON)][40491]. 
## Expansion ports
Several expansion options are provided: 
  * [A UEXT connector][40492]. This is meant for attaching [Olimex UEXT modules][40493].
  * [A 10 pin IO connector (GPIO-1)][40494].
  * [A 40 pin IO connector (GPIO-2)][40495].

TODO: verify that the GPIO pin-outs are a 1-1 match with the [A13-OLinuXino][40466]
# Adding a serial port

[][40498]
DEVICE UART pads
In the top left corner of the device, there are some pins marked UART1. The pin-out is described at the back of the board. All you have to do is connect some leads according to our [UART howto][40499].
