# Identification
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: MC7403A
  * Build Number: nuclear_pub_eng 4.0.4 iMM76D 20120712 test-keys

# Sunxi support
## Current status
No u-boot patch was made available, so therefor this device is not supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [szenio_1207c4.fex][59911]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][59912]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][59913]. 
## Booting from a SD card
The original page mentioned something about disabling the NAND in the .fex file, to allow booting from SD. This seemed quite curious, and the details have therefor been removed while awaiting confirmation. 
## Enabling the WiFi
It might be necessary to force usbc1 on so the kernel can detect the wifi controller. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

DEVICE UART pads
## Device disassembly
See [the Q8 tablet format disassembly page][59917]. 
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][59918].
