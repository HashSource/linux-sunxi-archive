# Sunxi support
## Current status
Unknown 
## Images
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][47328]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be removed.
## HW-Pack
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi HW-pack specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## BSP
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi BSP specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][47330] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][47331] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
There is a remote button that will start FEL mode, located underneath the device manufacturer's sticker, allowing you to enter FEL without disassembling the case. 
## Obtaining a root shell
Root shell can be obtained by using the UART: Connect the UART and establish a terminal session. Insert a USB thumb drive in either of the two USB host ports. It doesn't matter what is on the thumb drive, as long as it has a mountable filesystem (FAT is fine). Power on the board while continuously sending 's' via the serial console to interrupt u-boot. 
At the u-boot prompt, the process is as follows: 
[code] 
    redquark#setenv nand_root /dev/sda
    redquark#boot
    read boot or recovery all
    [     48.085]sunxi flash read :offset 1000000, 11549075 bytes OK

[/code]
Power off the board and boot normally. You should be able to log in as root using the password you set. 
## Default root password
The default root password for the TheC64 (Mini and full size) as well as the The VIC 20 is "chuckpeddle". 
## FEL mode
FEL can be entered by holding the remote button or the on board button labeled UBOOT. It can also be entered using the serial console by sending "2" on boot. 
## Board observations
There is a button on the board marked "Recovery" however it seems to have no effect. There is are many unpopulated solder pads including an SD card slot and second DRAM chip. The resistors are also unpopulated. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
[![C64MiniUART.JPG][47332]][47333]
[][47334]
The UART is very easy to interface. It has standard 0.01" American pin spacing and is already drilled. You can use standard header pins or a JST connector. 
Pins are, in order from top to bottom as per photo; 3.3v, Rx, Tx, GND 
In this photo, the customer has already added the UART pins. The board mounts upside down so the pins were placed on the reverse side to allow ease of access. 
See [UART howto][47335]
## Device disassembly
There is no need to remove or damage the device manufacturer's sticker unless you wish to access the u-boot switch without disassembling the case. The four screws are located under the friction pads. 
## Locating the UART
The UART is immediately West of the processor and very easy to see.
