# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "pcDuino" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [pcduino.fex][31178]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][31179]. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **Linksprite_pcDuino_defconfig** build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun4i-a10-pcduino.dts** device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][31180]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][31181].
