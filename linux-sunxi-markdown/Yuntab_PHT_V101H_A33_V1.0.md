# Sunxi support
## Current status
Not supported. 
## Images
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][63809]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be removed.
## HW-Pack
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi HW-pack specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## BSP
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi BSP specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][63811] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Using the _ga10h_v1_1_defconfig_ build target _seems_ to work (initial tests done). 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_PHT_V101H_A33_V1.0.fex_][63812] file ([Pull request][63813]). 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][63814]. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.
## Device disassembly
The device can easily be opened with a [Plastic tool][63815] (no screws). 
## Locating the UART
The UART has not been located yet. Maybe the [UART howto][63816] helps.

The device _seems_ to be very similar to the [IRULU X11][63826] as both have the same PCB label (PHT ...) and almost identical support chips. This [external site][63827] has some interesting info which could be helpful for the Yuntab as well.
