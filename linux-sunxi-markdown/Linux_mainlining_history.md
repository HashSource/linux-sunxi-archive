[![Exclamation.png][32498]][32499] Known problems:
  * Release tag v4.5 contains a change that broke _stmmac_ networking on quite a few sunxi devices. The symptoms are

[code] 
    [ 13.196778] libphy: PHY stmmac-0:ffffffff not found
    [ 13.204800] eth0: Could not attach to PHY
    [ 13.204809] stmmac_open: Cannot attach to PHY (error: -19)
[/code]
A quick fix is to revert commit **88f8b1b** which introduced the regression. See <http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2016-March/415939.html>, [https://www.mail-archive.com/[email protected]/msg104119.html][32500], <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=823493>.
