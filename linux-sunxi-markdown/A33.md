Allwinner A33 (sun8i) SoC features a Quad-Core Cortex-A7 ARM CPU, and a [Mali400][3426] MP2 GPU from ARM. It is a Quad-Core pin-to-pin-compatible version of [A23][3427] (which in turn is a lower power, cut-down, not-pin-compatible version of the [A20][3428]). 
It's now also called [R16][3429], targeted on miscellaneous IoT devices, such as [Nintendo NES Classic Edition][3430] gaming console.

# Software
## Allwinner support
A33 will officially support Android 4.4 and above from AllWinner, so no official multi-OS support like some other higher-end AllWinner SoCs. 
## Android SDK
### Expired
Below are links on pan baidu for the original A33 SDK. You will need to install the Baidu Yun Guanjia download manager in order to download the files.

[Allwinner A33 SDK [MEGA]][3465]
Build instructions are here 
  * [Build Instructions][3466]

I was able to succesfully build the SDK on Ubuntu 12.04 (after installing dependencies and java) and burn it to an SDCard using PhoenixCard and have it run on an A33 tablet. 
You may need to replace the y3 sys_config.fex with an appropriate fex for your A33 tablet. 
The build image works on several of my A33 tablets, but gets stuck on the loading screen on some others.
