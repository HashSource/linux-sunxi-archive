# Sunxi support
## Current status
Give a brief overview of the current status of support under sunxi here. If there is mainline support for either u-boot or kernel, mention this too, but add the extra sections below.
## Images
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][28611]
## HW-Pack
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE HW-pack specifics here.
## BSP
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE BSP specifics here.
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][28613]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][28614]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
If there is mainline u-boot support, add this section.
For [ building mainline u-boot][28615], use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target. 
Don't forget to add

at the bottom of the page.
## Mainline kernel
If there is mainline kernel support, add this section.
Use the FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][28616]. 
Don't forget to add

# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][28617]. 
## Device specific topic
## ...
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][28621]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][28622].
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][28621].
