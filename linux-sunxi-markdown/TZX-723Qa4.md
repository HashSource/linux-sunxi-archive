# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    The PCB has the following written on it:
    TZX-723Qa4
    
[/code]
  

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Following devices are unsupported: 
  * Wifi RDA5991
  * GSL1680 touch input
  * Accelometer Dmard09 or bma150?

## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Fex file
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the _q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [TZX-723Qa4.fex][53762]

## Mainline U-Boot
Supported in the [mainline u-boot git 'master' branch][53763]. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the _sun8i-a33-q8-tablet.dts_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][53764]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## Retrieving script.bin
Unlike, other allwinner devices,Script.bin is not present in the vfat partition(nanda) as file. 
Instead, It is located 0x43000000, it's size is 0x00020000. script.bin can be extracted from /dev/mem using mmap(). 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
