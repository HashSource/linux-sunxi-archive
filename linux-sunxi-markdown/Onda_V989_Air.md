# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    ONDA
    V989 AIR
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    INET-N978-REV02
    Zeng-gc 2014-12-31
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _V989 Air Core8_
  * Build Number: _A83T_N978_N9781L2BC_1501088.20150527_
  * Kernel version: _Linux version 3.4.39 (inet_lzq@superFAE03) (gcc version 4.6.3 20120201 (prerelease) (crosstool-NG linaro-1.13.1-2012.02-20120222 - Linaro GCC 2012.02))_

# Sunxi support
Needs a lot of work. 
## Current status
No Uboot defconfig at this moment. 
No defconfig in linux-sunxi project. 
A83T kernel sources were released April, 17 2015 [Github][41680]
## Images
No sunxi images availible at this moment. See Manufacturer images
## HW-Pack
No HW-pack availible. 
## BSP
No BSP availible. 
## Manual build
  * For building U-Boot, use the _onda_v989_air_defconfig_ target, which will soon be added.
  * The .fex file soon could be found in sunxi-boards as [onda_v989_air.fex][41681]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][41682]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
If there is mainline U-Boot support, add this section.
For [ building mainline U-Boot][41683], use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target. 
Don't forget to add 
[code]
    [[Category:Mainline_U-Boot]]
[/code]
at the bottom of the page.
## Mainline kernel
If there is mainline kernel support, add this section.
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][41684]. 
Don't forget to add 
[code]
    [[Category:Mainline_Kernel]]

at the bottom of the page.
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][41685]. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][41689]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][41690].
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][41689].
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][41691], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
