# Overview
The Allwinner H133 (sun8i) SoC features a Dual-Core Cortex-A7 ARM CPU, Support DDR2 and DDR3 memory. designed for 4K decoding platform. H133 supports full format decoding such as H.265, H.264, MPEG-1/2/4, JPEG, VC1, and so on. The independent encoder can encode in JPEG or MJPEG. Integrated multi ADCs/DACs. It's wafer is same as T113-s3 but lead out HDMI and no SIP DRAM, all peripherals being identical.
