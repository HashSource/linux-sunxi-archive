DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][33286]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
Remove the two screws from the top of the device, on either side of the I/O ports. Then use a small plastic tool to pry the back cover off of the LCD screen. Insert the tool between the black bezel and grey aluminum back cover. Slowly repeat the process around the circumference of the device. 
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][33286].
