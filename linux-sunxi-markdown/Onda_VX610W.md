# Identification
Find out the strings as reported under settings.
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: DEVICE
  * Build Number: SOC_BOARD_DEVICE_*.*

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Not supported. No patches have ever been submitted.
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][41764]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][41765]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
