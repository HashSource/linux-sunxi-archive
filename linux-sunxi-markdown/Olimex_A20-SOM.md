# Identification
The board helpfully reads "A20-SOM". 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the _Olimex_A20-SOM_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [olimex_a20_som_evb.fex][41069]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][41070]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The _Recovery_ button triggers [ FEL mode][41071]. 
## LCD Modules
## Expansion Ports
## LDO3 (Port E / CSI0 Power Supply) Problem
When the A20-SOM is connected to the A20-SOM-EVB base board sold by Olimex and the LDO3 of the AXP209 chip is initially switched off by uboot (which newer uboot versions do by default), **LDO3 should never be re-enabled**. Doing so leads to immediate shut down of the AXP209 resulting in a crash of the board. The reason seems to be too much capacitance on the lines connected to the LDO3 output and non-effective voltage rate control on the AXP209 for LDO3, leading to excessive inrush currents and triggering the overcurrent-protection of the AXP.

UART connector
A nicely labeled UART connector is available, all you have to do is attach some leads according to our [UART howto][41075].
