# Sunxi support
## Current status
Give a brief overview of the current status of support under sunxi here.
## Images
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][59506]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be removed.
## HW-Pack
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi HW-pack specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## BSP
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi BSP specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][59507] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Only useful for A10/A10s/A13 and A20 based devices. Remove this section otherwise.
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Only useful for A10/A10s/A13 and A20 based devices. Remove this section otherwise.
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][59508] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
## FEL mode
The Home or Volume + buttons trigger [ FEL mode][59509].

X-View Proton Tab 2 UART pads
Luckily this device has easy and exposed pads to solder three wires for a UART interface. Refer to [UART howto][59513] for more information. 
## Device disassembly
The back cover is the first part to come out. Refer to [Plastic tool howto][59514] for more information on how to open the device. 
## Locating the UART
The three pads are located right above the nand flash. Removing the battery or softening the adhesive is recommended to avoid touching it with the soldering iron. For more information refer to [UART howto][59513].
