# Identification
The SOM has "FETA40i-C" silkscreened on it in the upper left corner; The carrier devboard has "OKA40i-C [version]" near the fullsize SD card slot. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Manufacturer-provided images/sources available (kernel 3.10). 
Experimental support with mainline U-Boot. Mainline Linux (Armbian) has been made to run on this board. 
Currently working code available at <https://github.com/flashcactus/u-boot/tree/sunxi-feta40i-config-rb>. 
## Images
Apparently provided by the board/SoM manufacturer to customers only. Contains Allwinner BSP based images, SDKs, schematics and other information, with the usual complete ignorance towards mainline work. 
## Manual build
No mainline support yet. Experiments should start off the other [R40/A40i][19707] boards. DRAM is apparently dual-rank, which is not yet supported by mainline U-Boot (but you can try to make it work anyway if you really want). 
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][19708] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
Use the repository at <https://github.com/flashcactus/u-boot/tree/sunxi-feta40i-config-rb>, using the _OKA40i_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
The mainline kernel runs on this board without any additional modification. For now, compile the _sun8i-r40-OKA40i-C_ device tree from the U-Boot repository listed above. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
  * The full-size SD card slot is bootable; the micro-SD is for storage only.
  * The red DIP switch near the SoM socket changes the BROM boot priority: eMMC is tried first when the switch is in the "On" position, and the SD card first when it is off.

## FEL mode
The "Boot" button next to the reset button triggers [ FEL mode][19709]. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.
# Adding a serial port
Standard DB9 serial connector gives access to the debug UART.
