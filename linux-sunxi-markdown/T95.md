# Identification
The top of the device has a logo with a large "T95" in a circle. 
On the bottom the device is printed: 
[code] 
    T95 (5G)
    RAM: 4GB  ROM: 32GB
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    H616-T95MAX-AXP313A-v3.0
[/code]
or in some case you can found: 
[code] 
    H616-T95MAX-v4.0
[/code]
If the motherboard is the V4.0 the box is the same as [T95H][53154]. 
  
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _MBOX_
  * Build Number: _10.1.X18_ or _10.1.X19_ or _10.1.A27_ or _10.1.A29-0712_ or _10.1.A32-1201_

the build number with the 'X' is used for [XR819][53133] version WiFi 2.4GHz only; the build number with the 'A' is used for [AW859A][53132]/[BCM4334][53131] version Wi-Fi dual-band 2.4/5GHz and bluetooth 4.0. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Support is work in progress. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][53155] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### Mainline U-Boot
While I was able to boot Mainline U-Boot (tagged v2023.01-rc2) from an SD card, I did not succeed in getting a working prompt. I used the U-Boot configuration `x96_mate_defconfig` as a starting point, and went through many variations of this configuration. 
_The one configuration change/addition that I was able to determine was absolutely necessary was:_ `CONFIG_SPL_IMAGE_TYPE_SUNXI_TOC0=y`
I'm told the T95 has secure boot enabled, and it won't load Mainline U-Boot without TOC0. With TOC0 enabled, the T95 output was: 
[code] 
    U-Boot SPL 2023.01-rc2 (Dec 01 2022 - 13:43:28 -0700)
    DRAM: 4096 MiB
    Failed to set core voltage! Can't set CPU frequency
    SP 
    
[/code]
_What's wrong?_
I was just a conduit through which _apritzel_ was troubleshooting, but my impression was the issue related to RAM timing. With `CONFIG_SPL_IMAGE_TYPE_SUNXI_TOC0=y` present in every configuration attempt, we tried: 
  * Removing every line with I2C in the configuration and add `CONFIG_SUNXI_NO_PMIC=y`
  * Setting/Lowering DRAM frequency with `CONFIG_DRAM_CLK=624`
  * Copying DRAM parameters from the `orangepi_zero2_defconfig` U-Boot configuration
  * `CONFIG_DRAM_SUN50I_H616_READ_CALIBRATION=y` and `"CONFIG_DRAM_SUN50I_H616_UNKNOWN_FEATURE=y`

All these attempts resulted in U-Boot quickly freezing on boot. 
**A basic U-Boot compile workflow:**
[code] 
    $ git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
    $ cd u-boot
    $ git checkout v2023.01-rc2
    $ cd ..
    $ git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware.git
    $ cd arm-trusted-firmware
    $ make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- PLAT=sun50i_h616 DEBUG=1 bl31
    $ cd ../u-boot
    $ make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- BL31=../arm-trusted-firmware/build/sun50i_h616/debug/bl31.bin x96_mate_defconfig
    $ make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- BL31=../arm-trusted-firmware/build/sun50i_h616/debug/bl31.bin menuconfig
    $ make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- BL31=../arm-trusted-firmware/build/sun50i_h616/debug/bl31.bin
    $ dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 seek=8
    
[/code]
Probably U-Boot need AXP313a Power Managment PMIC support, that is in WIP[[1]][53156]
Also a locked bootloader seems to be a problem, firmware until X/A23 should have an unlocked/unlockable bootloader, since X/A24 you cannot unlock your bootloader (I'm tryng with brute force actually, if fail I will try FEL mode). 
  
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Mainline Linux kernel
Use the **sun50i-h616-t95max-axp313.dtb** device-tree binary. (WIP)[[2]][53157]
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The button behind the 3.5mm audio jack (labeled UBOOT on the board) triggers [ FEL mode][53158]. This button can be pressed even while the board is in its case by sticking something like a paperclip straight through the 3.5mm jack. Feel around for something that "clicks". 
## Device specific topic
Board V4.0 comes with an XR819 Wi-Fi module. It sits behind the SD card slot. On the top side of the board sits an AXP305 PMIC. I have a 16 GB NAND flash + 2 GB RAM (8x Hynix H5TC2G43BFR) variant. 
Exist much different variant of MBOX T95 many of which have malware pre-installed[[3]][53159]. 
on the label in the retro of the base will be printed: 
[code] 
    T95 or T95 (5G)
    RAM: 2 or 4 or 8 GB  ROM: 16 or 32 or 64 or 128 GB
[/code]
In all or probably much cases this info are totally fake (as is now customary in many TV boxes), a modification (hack) has been installed to cheat on the amount of total space in both RAM and ROM. 
Furthermore, recently the chips were printed with false information, so (in much case) it is useless to open the case and read them. Also please note that [H616][53130] cannot recognize over 4GB of RAM. 
To find exactly your RAM amount you can install a RAM filler app or better examine with a hex editor the file '/proc/device-tree/memory@40000000/reg', the last bytes stands for the real amount of RAM: 
[code] 
    00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 you have only 1GiB of RAM;
    00 00 00 00 80 00 00 00 you have only 2GiB of RAM;
    00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 you are very very lucky, 4GiB of RAM.
[/code]
To find your ROM dimension you can fill it with file and the analyze every file with rdiff or other tools. 
The board can have different Wi-Fi module: [XR819][53133] Wi-Fi 2.4GHz only or [AW859A][53132]/[BCM4334][53131] Wi-Fi dual-band 2.4/5GHz and bluetooth 4.0 and FM support (probably antenna to jack not soldered on the board, not supported by official ROM).

# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
_This thing had a warranty?_
To attach a serial console you'll need to open the T95 case and solder on wires or headers to the UART pads. Afterwards, you'll need to a UART-USB dongle or similar. See the [UART howto][53160] for more details. 
[![][53161]][53162]
[][53163]
UART pads - with headers already soldered on.
[![][53164]][53165]
[][53166]
Pads to short to enable console RX
## Device disassembly
You can pop off the bottom of the T95 case using the average [Plastic tool][53167]. The bottom is held in using small clips only. If your case is like mine I'd suggest starting at the side with the Ethernet and HDMI connector. 
## Locating the UART
The UART pads are located between the USB0 port and the µSD slot. Refer to the picture at the side. 
Connecting your serial console to these pads alone will be sufficient to read T95 console output, but the T95 will not receive any input. To allow console input two pads will need to be shorted on the underside of the board. Look for three tightly-grouped pads on the underside of the board, about 10mm off the back of USB0. Also, see the picture at the side. 
**From _apritzel_ on IRC:**
> _[12:48] <apritzel>_ upnix: as for the serial console: some of those TV boxes tend to drop a FET and resistor for the some UART pins, so you may be able to see output, but not be able to talk to the box 
> _[12:49] <apritzel>_ see here for an example: [https://linux-sunxi.org/Eachlink_H6_Mini#Adding_a_serial_port_.28might_void_warranty.3F.29][53168]

# Schematic
List schematics, board layout, cad files, etc here.
# Also known as
"T95" seems to be a popular name, used in many different TV boxes, with different SoCs. This is the version without any suffix (just "T95"), but make sure you get the "H616" version of it. 
The brand name can change, like "Pendoo" or "Antfraer" or "LinQ" or much others, normally printed on the circle upper the T95 logo. This is pretty normal, since if you buy this tvbox (but also others) online in big quantity you can choose your own "custom" logo (and add your own logo or rewrite totally the image on the box) and rebrand the tvbox. They offer also custom chipset (RAM, ROM and Wi-Fi), so you can found different chipset on it.
