# Identification
The board helpfully reads "Cubietech" "Cubieboard.org" and has an A10 chip on it. :) 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
The cubieboard is well represented within the main sunxi developer community and has excellent support both in u-boot as well as 3.4 and mainline kernels. 
## Images
  * [Android firmwares.][14937]
  * [Fedora images.][14938]
  * [Ubuntu images.][14939]
  * Image creation for ArchLinuxARM (or ALARM) : [Cubieboard][14940].

Cubietech also has a bunch of official firmwares available on their [download][14941] page. 
## HW-Pack
Generating a HW pack for the cubieboard is easily done with the sunxi-bsp and well supported. 
## BSP
Under the BSP the cubieboard is simply known as cubieboard. Just run: 
[code] 
    ./configure cubieboard
    make
    
[/code]
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][14942] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _Cubieboard_ build target. 
#### Upstream/Mainline U-Boot
Use the _Cubieboard_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_cubieboard.fex_][14943] file. 
#### Upstream/Mainline kernel
Use the _sun4i-a10-cubieboard.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the sun4i-a10-cubieboard.dts device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][14944]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The FEL button triggers [ FEL mode][14945].

# Adding a serial port
[![][14958]][14959]
[][14960]
DEVICE UART pads
There is a nice 2.54mm pin header near to the SoC. All you have to do is connect the correct wires, according to our [UART howto][14961] or the [ Cubieboard TTL howto][14962]. [![Exclamation-red.png][14963]][14964] **Do not connect Vcc as that might damage your board.**

# Also known as
The cubieboard was a major success, and it has become a name of its own. Therefore, no rebadging has taken place, but there might be some bad chinese rip-offs out there, which carry the same name.
