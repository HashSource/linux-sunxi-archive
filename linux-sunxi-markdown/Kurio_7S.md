# Identification
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: Kurio7S
  * Build Number: C13000A120a.20131218.160640

# Sunxi support
## Current status
I'm working to Debian Xfce and Kali linux(images cubieboard 2):  
Kernel 3.4.102/3.4.103   
Work now:  
-Lcd  
-Touchscreen  
-Hdmi  
-USB (OTG, charging working)  
-Audio  
-Debug (UART)  
-Wifi  
-Power button  

Not work (yet) :  
-Camera (Front,Rear)  
-NAND (Debian wheezy)  
-Volume +/-  

The touchscreen is *not* working with the base driver, at least in my Kurio 7S(but works fine on Android4.2.2 and in the Cubian tutorial after /etc/modules)

## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "Kurio_7S" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [kurio_7s.fex][29716]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][29717]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
##### Touchscreen:
Edit linux-sunxi-sunxi-3.4/drivers/input/touchscreen/ft5x_ts.c 
Removed the "IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING |" line (1765) compiled kernel and now works 
##### Right mouse click evdev
[code] 
           $sudo mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
           $sudo touch /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/evdev.conf
           $sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/evdev.conf
    
[/code]
[code] 
           Section "InputClass"
                   Identifier "Touchscreen"
                   MatchProduct "ft5x_ts"
                   Driver "evdev"
                   Option "EmulateThirdButton" "1"
                   Option "EmulateThirdButtonTimeout" "1000"
                   Option "EmulateThirdButtonMoveThreshold" "30"
           EndSection
    
[/code]
##### Battery:
Folder battery info cappacity,status, etc. 
[code] 
           /sys/class/power_supply/battery/ 
    
[/code]
  

##### Code lcd off and touchscreen
NUM_DEVICE check 
[code] 
           $xinput | grep ft5x_ts 
    
[/code]
Create power file and add keyboard shortcut to power button 
[code] 
            $sudo vim /usr/bin/power
    
            #!/bin/bash
            NUM_DEVICE=7
            ENABLED=`xinput --list-props $NUM_DEVICE | grep "Device Enabled" | awk '{print $4}'`
            if [ $ENABLED = 0 ]; then
                    xinput enable $NUM_DEVICE
                    xset dpms force on
            else
                    xinput disable $NUM_DEVICE
                    xset dpms force off
            fi
            exit 0 
    
[/code]
## FEL mode
The Vol- [ FEL mode][29718].  
The Vol+ triggers [ Recovery mode][29719]

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][29723]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][29724].
## Locating the UART
Under the processor are Tx, Rx.  

Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][29723].
