# Overview
## Main components of the A10s:
  * CPU: [Cortex-A8 1GHz (ARM v7) Processor][1668] which have both VFPv3 and NEON co-processors: 
    * FPU: standard ARM VFPv3 FPU Floating Point Unit
    * SIMD: NEON (ARM's extended general-purpose SIMD vector processing extension engine)
  * GPU: [Mali400][1658]
  * VPU: [Cedar Engine][1659] (Video Processor Unit for audio and video hardware decoding or encoding)
  * HDMI-transmitter: HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control)

The A10s is a cheaper version of the [A10][1669] which lacks SATA-controller, as it is primarily targeted towards HDMI plug PC.
