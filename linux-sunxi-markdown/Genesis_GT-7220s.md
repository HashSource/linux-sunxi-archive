The Genesis GT-7220s is a cheap Chinese A10 tablet that used to be sold in Brazil circa 2012. I can't find more information about it in the Internet because most of its community was found in the Genesis Series forums, which have been since taken down.

# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    Skyworth
    GT-7220S
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    A702_MB_V1.6
    2012.06.19
[/code]
My sample of the device had a custom ROM spoofing it as a Samsung tablet before I started researching it, so I can't provide correct Android identification strings. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
This device is not currently supported by the project. I am working on porting both mainline U-Boot and Linux to it. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][21943] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
Please note that, since this device is in the process of being supported, the patches containing the settings below probably won't be upstreamed yet. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
n/a 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _Genesis_GT7220s_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_genesis_gt7220.fex_][21944] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _sun4i-a10-genesis-gt7220s.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][21945]. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][21949]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][21950].
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][21949].
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][21951], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
