# Ubuntu
You can find armhf Ubuntu images on their [website][57420]. Up until release 13.10, Ubuntu had complete distributions packaged and available, but for the 14.04 release there is only Ubuntu Core packaged for armhf. Ubuntu Core is a minimal set of packages with which to get started, but you'll have to "roll your own" distribution if you want to do anything. Note that they have a full repository of packages compiled for armhf, it's just that a complete set of packages is not available in a single cd image 
Both AllWinner and Ubuntu are members of Linaro, and Linaro has supported Ubuntu on ARM for the last few years.
