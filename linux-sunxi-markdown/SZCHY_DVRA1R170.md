# Identification
On my exemplar there were no external marks of a brand or model! 
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    DS_DVR_A10_A1_V2.1 TEAN 3215
    2014/03/27
[/code]
Then, below, a label was saying 
[code] 
    A1-A20V-V2.1
    2010335
    SMD15.12.26
[/code]
maybe this design started with an Allwinner A10, and then it was ported to A20 (as it's pin to pin compatible! 
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _DEVICE_
  * Build Number: _SOC_BOARD_DEVICE_*.*_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
A pretty stock image of for an A20 based device, can boot from the microSD and work on console. what's seen on dmesg and tested: 
  * the microSD is seen, and tested on read/write
  * the HDMI is seen by the 4.15 DRM but still not tested. looking for the proper cable.

Trying to recover the fex to enable the internal LCD and camera and other peripherals 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][48664] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
This is the log of the provided ROM at boot over console:

#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][48665] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary.

## FEL mode
I've been able to get to fel mode, with the serial console, pressing 2 at power up:

## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.
## ...
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
on the back of the PCB there are the PADS for the console UART. used small rework wires. tested working. 
## Device disassembly
There are 4 screws behind the silver brackets, then you can pry open with a flat scredriver in the minijack, 
## Locating the UART
The pads are clearly marked on the back of the PCB; see image below. use wirewraps for electronic reworks. tested working
