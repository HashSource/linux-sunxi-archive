#### Mainline U-Boot
The unit will begin to boot if u-bot if built with Sinlinx_SinA33_defconfig 
Interfaces appear and disappear while booting, but attempts to connect so far have been unsuccessful. Because the LCD isn't correctly configured no console shows on the screen. 
The unit shares more similarities with PHT_801H_A33_V1.0.fex but no defconfig file exists

Unknown 
#### Mainline kernel
Unknown 
## FEL mode
The unit can be put into FEL mode by booting with a suitable microsd card. See instructions for sunxi-tools 
## Note
