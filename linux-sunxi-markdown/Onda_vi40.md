DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][41854]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
First need to remove the rubber caps in each corner on the back plate and then remove the tiny screws. Then we've GOT SOME HEADACHES! as it seems the case is glued shut see: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvyKorhEncY>
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][41854].
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][41855], and add them here.
