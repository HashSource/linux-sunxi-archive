A standard [A13][46077] based, [Q8 style][46081] device with separate [UART][46082] pads. 
This motherboard seems to have been used in several rebadges, and will come with different batteries, different cameras, and perhaps different Wifi modules and last but not last, this form factor is used in [A23][46083] and [A33][46084] tablet.

# Identification
The back of the PCB reads **Q8-V12.** , but google reveals that there are highly similar PCBs where a different name is silkscreened on the backside. 
For the Point Of View Mobii 703, you will find, in android, under Settings->About Tablet: 
  * Model Number: POV_TAB_P703(V1.0)
  * Build Number: nuclear_evb-eng 4.1.1 JRO03C 201311126 test-keys

The Build string is not helpful, as "nuclear_evb" just means [A13][46077] evaluation board. 
To properly identify this device, [open up the case][46096], detach the motherboard, and look at the printing on the other side. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][46101] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _POV_TAB_P703_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_pov_tab_p703.fex_][46102] file. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Volume+ button triggers [ FEL mode][46103]. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

UART pads
## Device disassembly
See [the Q8 tablet format disassembly page][46107]. 
## Locating the UART
On the back of the mainboard, there are two test pads near the SoC. Solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][46082].
