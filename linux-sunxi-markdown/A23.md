# Overview
The A23 is not supported in the linux-sunxi 3.4 kernel and in u-boot-sunxi, but there is basic support in the [mainline Linux kernel][3000] (since kernel 3.17/3.18) and in [mainline u-boot][3001] (since v2015.04).

# Software
## Original SDK
  * [SDK (4GB tarball)][3012]
  * [SDK (unpacked)][3013]

The SDK contains customized sources for U-boot, Linux, Android and buildroot. It also has a gnueabi cross compile toolchain. 
### SDK Content
  * Linux Kernel: A23/lichee/linux-3.4
  * Buildroot: A23/lichee/buildroot
  * U-boot: A23/lichee/brandy/u-boot-2011.09
  * ARM gnueabi cross compile toolchain: A23/lichee/brandy/gcc-linaro/
  * Android: A23/android
  * Various Allwinner tools: A23/lichee/tools

Use the "pack" script under "A23/lichee/tools/pack" to build an image. (not tested) 
## Boot0
[Boot0][3014] initializes the DRAM, basic clocks and loads U-boot from NAND or MMC. There is no boot1 on A23. Boot0 directly loads U-boot. 
Allwinner has in the meantime published the source code for boot0 in their github repository. 
Binaries of boot0 can be found in the SDK: [A23/lichee/tools/pack/chips/sun8iw3p1/bin][3015]
fes1_sun8iw3p1.bin is for FEL mode. 
## U-boot
There are 3 U-boot sources available. 
### Allwinner
Allwinner's SDK contains a customized U-boot, based on v2011.09. This works with either NAND or MMC. It contains drivers for LCD display, MMC, NAND, normal UARTs, USB OTG, RSB, PMIC, and the ability to update various images. 
### Sunxi Community
[u-boot-sunxi][3016] has basic support for A23, which includes UART console (including R_UART) and MMC. Disclaimer: no one has actually booted a kernel with this yet. 
Work still needed: 
  * SPL (DRAM initialization code)
  * [Reduced_Serial_Bus][3005] driver (to talk to AXP PMIC).

### Mainline U-Boot
[mainline u-boot][3001] has support for the A23 (incl. SPL and AXP223 PMIC support) since v2015.04. 
## Kernel code
### Allwinner
There is a kernel tree currently available which contains a quick backport of the A23-v1.0 SDK, [it is called "a23sdk_frankenkernel".][3017]
This tree contains: 
  * The Android 3.4.39 kernel
  * loads of nasty backports on top: 
    * direct commits from upstream or android trees
    * commits from upstream or android trees with changes to certain files removed
  * the remaining diff to the A23-v1.0 SDK packed on top: 
    * with fixed encodings (to UTF-8), where possible, as some allwinner side encoding mess-up has destroyed data
    * fixed file permissions
    * remaining changes which could not easily be tracked back to upstream or android tree commits

TODO: 
  * remove useless/dead files: 
    * vexpress and realview ael.
    * changes to other architectures.
    * pointless scripts
    * other obviously useless files.
  * Separate out some drivers to their original versions so allwinner specific changes become visible: 
    * the 3 mali kernel driver versions
    * the many added wireless drivers
  * build and run testing.

### Sunxi Community
Patches for basic A23 support on mainline have been posted on the mailing list. You can also find them [here][3018]. 
## GPL violations
The [v1.0 SDK][3012] contains many binaries and is therefor violating the GPLv2 quite directly: 
  * Kernel: 
    * [kernel/drivers/devfreq/dramfreq/mdfs/mdfs.code][3019]
    * [kernel/drivers/arisc/binary/arisc_sun8iw1p1.code][3020]
    * [kernel/drivers/arisc/binary/arisc_sun9iw1p1.code][3021]
    * [`drivers/media/video/sunxi-vfe/lib/libisp`][3022]
    * [`modules/nand/sun8iw1p1/libnand_sun8iw1p1`][3023]
    * [`modules/nand/sun8iw3p1/libnand_sun8iw3p1`][3024]
    * [`modules/nand/sun9iw1p1/libnand_sun9iw1p1`][3025]
    * [`drivers/input/touchscreen/aw5x06/libAW5306`][3026]
    * [`drivers/input/touchscreen/gslx680new/gsl_point_id_20130415`][3027]
  * U-boot: 
    * [`nand_sunxi/sun8iw3/libnand-sun8iw3`][3028]

We are still waiting on action from Allwinner to resolve this.
