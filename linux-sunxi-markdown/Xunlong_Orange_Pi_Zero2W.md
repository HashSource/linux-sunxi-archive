# Identification
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it:

# Sunxi support
## Current status
DT in kernel tree since Linux v6.8. The expansion board overlay is still missing, and the 100 Mbit/s Ethernet port relies on the still missing internal PHY support. 
## Images
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][62868]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be removed.
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][62870] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _orangepi_zero2w_defconfig_ build target. 
### Mainline Linux Kernel
Use the _sun50i-h618-orangepi-zero2w.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
There is no FEL button, and out of the box there is some bootable image on the SPI flash, which prevents [ FEL mode][62871] when booting without an SD card. 
You can either disable SPI booting by overwriting the first few bytes of the SPI flash, or boot from an SD card with fel-sdboot.sunxi on it. 
## Expansion board
# Adding a serial port

DEVICE UART pads
There are no dedicated [UART][62875] pins, but UART0 is connected to the GPIO header pins, at the same location as on Raspberry Pi boards (pins 8 & 10).
