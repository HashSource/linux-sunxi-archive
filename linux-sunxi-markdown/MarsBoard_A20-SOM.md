The MarsBoard A20-SOM was a short-lived, credit-card sized, extendable board with an Allwinner [A20][35581] SoC. The SOM variant (different from [Marsboard A20][35586]) has a completely different design though, with a SOM and a baseboard.

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Give a brief overview of the current status of support under sunxi here. If there is mainline support for either u-boot or kernel, mention this too, but add the extra sections below.
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][35600]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][35601]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
Not currently supported. 
## Mainline kernel
Not currently supported. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
