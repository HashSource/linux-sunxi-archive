# Identification
Current PCB version is 3.0, under mass production.. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Board is running sunxi uboot and sunxi kernel 3.4.79, with debian wheezy rootfs. 
## Images
This is a proprietary product, therefore its images can not be published here :( 
## HW-Pack
Does not exist. The board runs Android 4.2.2 and sunxi kernel. A working linux system can be built easily similar to any other A20 based device. 
## BSP
Does not exists. 
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "Interra-3" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [interra-3.fex][63733]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][63734]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
The board has two buttons, one is RESET and the other is RECOVERY. 
## FEL mode
In order to enter Recovery mode, either press RECOVERY button, or use fel-sdboot binary 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
Please see below. 
## Locating the UART
The board has 3.3V TTL UART DEBUG port on it directly visible ( and written ) on the PCB silkscreen.
