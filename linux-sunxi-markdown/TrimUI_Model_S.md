# Identification
"TRIMUI MODEL S" is printed on the back of the device as well as the front of the PCB (visible through the clear front casing) 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Give a brief overview of the current status of support under sunxi here.
## Images
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][55755]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be removed.
## HW-Pack
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi HW-pack specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## BSP
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi BSP specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][55757] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Only useful for A10/A10s/A13 and A20 based devices. Remove this section otherwise.
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Only useful for A10/A10s/A13 and A20 based devices. Remove this section otherwise.
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][55758] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
Turn off the device, remove the uSD card. The uSD card **must** be removed, otherwise the device will boot normally. Hold the "L" and "R" shoulder buttons while turning the device on. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.

TrimUI Model S UART pads
There are UART test pads inside the device. You will need to solder jumper wires to access them, see [UART howto][55762] for details. 
## Device disassembly
Unscrew the four self-tapping Torx T6 screws from the back of the device. Remove the aluminum back panel and the plastic spacer. 
## Locating the UART
The UART test pads are near the NAND flash chip, labeled U1_RX, U1_TX, and GND. 
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][55763], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
