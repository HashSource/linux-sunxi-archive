# AXP802
The **AXP802** is the PMIC (Power Management IC) developed by [X-Powers][5846], a sister company of [Allwinner][5847]. 
## Overview
AXP802 is A customized PMIC for multi-power rails required SOC platform. 
AXP802 is a highly integrated PMIC targeting at Li-battery (Li-ion or Li-polymer) applications that require multi-channel power conversion outputs. It provides an easy and flexible power management solution for processors to meet the increasingly complex and accurate requirements on power control. 
AXP802 comes with an adaptive USB3.0-compatible Flash Charger that supports up to 2.8A charge current. It also supports 22 channels power outputs (including 6-CH DCDCs). To ensure the security and stability of the power system, AXP802 provides multiple channels 12-bit ADC for voltage/current/temperature monitor and integrates protection circuits such as OVP, UVP, OTP, and OCP. Moreover, AXP802 features a unique E-Gauge™ (Fuel Gauge) system, making power gauge easy and exact. 
In addition, AXP802 embraces a fast interface for the system to dynamically adjust output voltage and enable power outputs so that the battery life can be extended to the largest extent. 
Besides, AXP802 features an IPS™ (Intelligent Power Select) circuit to transparently select power path among ACIN/USB and Li-battery to system load. 
AXP802 is available in 8mm x 8mm 68-pin QFN package, and the package is Pb free.
