The Iteaduino Plus is an arduino compatible baseboard, which can take [A10][28342] and [A20][28343] "core"-boards. The result is called either an Iteaduino Plus A10 or an Iteaduino Plus A20. 
The baseboard is OSHW ([design files are here][28346]), while the core board has schematics available. Sadly, this board was designed with [Cadence Allegro][28347], which limits these files usefulness. Itead studios [claimed to intend to switch to KiCAD][28348] for future designs, but this does not seem to have happened.

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported.

## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
### For the A10 core board
  * For building u-boot, use the "Iteaduino_Plus_A10" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [iteaduino_plus_a10.fex][28362]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][28363]. 
### For the A20 core board
  * For building u-boot, use the "Iteaduino_Plus_A20" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [iteaduino_plus_a20.fex][28364]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][28363]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
There is no button to enter FEL mode on the iTeaduino Core or iTeaduino Plus baseboard. You must short the uBoot pin to ground using a jumper wire to enter FEL mode (pin 102 on the Core, pin 139 on the Plus baseboard). 
# Adding a serial port
[![][28365]][28366]
[][28367]
DEVICE UART pads
There is a nice 2.54mm female pin header under the MicroSD slot, at the bottom side of the board. All you have to do is connect male jumper wires according to our [UART howto][28368]. 
**Do not connect Vcc as that might damage your board.**
