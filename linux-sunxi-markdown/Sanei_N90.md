# Identification
In Android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: M9701
  * Build Number: crane_anpei-eng 4.0.3 IML74K 20120622 test-keys

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Fully supported (except for the cameras) by the legacy U-Boot and kernel; _not_ yet supported by upstream U-Boot or kernel. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][48847] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _Sanei_N90_ build target. 
#### Upstream/Mainline U-Boot
Not supported. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_sanei_n90.fex_][48848] file. 
#### Upstream/Mainline kernel
Not supported. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## Camera
Interesting work, but this needs a better solution, like some patches or so.
As shipped, the device has "gc0308" and "gc0308b" modules loaded for the two cameras. Source for the latter doesn't appear to be available, but disassembling the two binaries shows that they're identical except that references to "client->addr" (the camera's I2C address) in "gc0308" have been changed to "0x21" in "gc0308b", and the "CSI_SUBDEV_PWR_OFF" handler in "sensor_power" calls "csi_gpio_write" rather than "csi_gpio_set_status". The hardcoded I2C address doesn't match the one in the shipped .fex file. 
## FEL mode
The Vol+ button triggers [FEL mode][48849].

DEVICE UART pads
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped.
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][48853].

# Variants
Ampe/Sanei have used the same model names for later tablets using the same form factor, which aren't Allwinner-based. The original "single core" version, using an Allwinner A10, was released in February 2012 ([press release][48863]). They've since built a "dual core" version using the Rockchip RK3066, and a "quad core" version ([Ampe A90][48864], [Sanei N90][48865]) using the Mediatek MTK8382.
