# Identification
The PCB features the "Avaota A1" name prominently in the middle, above the Avaota logo. On the underside, on the bottom left corner, close to the Ethernet jacks, it shows the hardware version number. 
The latest version so far is v1.7. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported for basic headless use cases in mainline Linux and U-Boot, development closely follows the A523/T527 upstreaming progress. USB3.0 and support for the second Ethernet port are work in progress, with patches being on the list already. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][63887] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _avaota-a1_defconfig_ build target. Supported since v2025.10-rc1. 
There is also [Syterkit][63888], an Open Source project for an alternative bootloader, using a binary blob to do the critical DRAM initialisation. That could be used to load a mainline U-Boot proper build or Linux kernels directly as well. 
### Mainline Linux Kernel
Basic headless support is working since v6.15, with the DT being merged in v6.16. 
Use the _sun55i-t527-avaota-a1.dtb_ device-tree binary.

DEVICE UART pads
The boot console is connected to pins on the 40pin GPIO header connector, in the same location as on the Raspberry Pi 2: pin 6 for TX, pin 8 for TX, pin 4 for GND. It's the usual 3.3V TTL level, refer to the [UART howto][63893] for more details.
