# Identification
This section explains how to most easily identify your device. For a development board, explain the name(s) printed on the board. For an android device, find out the strings as reported under settings.
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it:

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Give a brief overview of the current status of support under sunxi here. Works fine with q8_a33_tablet_800x480_defconfig 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][5168] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Mainline kernel
Use the _sun8i-a33-q8-tablet.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
## FEL mode
When tablet is off, hold both volume buttons and power button, release power button and start pressing it for 3 seconds

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][5172]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
2 UART pads are just below A33 SoC package. 
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][5173].
Standard Q8 disassembly applies 
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][5172]. 2 UART pads are just below A33 SoC package. 
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][5174], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
