DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][26417]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][26418].
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][26417].
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][26419], and add them here.
