The successor of the original [PineA64+][44359], in the same form factor, but with different DRAM (2GB LPDDR3), 16MiB SPI flash and an eMMC socket. It also replaces the microUSB power-only connector with a barrel plug. As the name LTS suggests, this model is available for a longer period, at least until 2022. The usage of LPDDR3 DRAM makes normal firmware images incompatible with the original Pine64(+).

# Identification
Has the Pine64 pine cone logo on the bottom right corner, also states "PINE64-R18-V1_x" along with a date just under the RPi2 style GPIO header. 
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    Designed in Silicon Valley, California.
    Built in Silicon Delta, China
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    PINE64-R18-V1_1

(early version) 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Well supported by mainline U-Boot, Trusted Firmware and the Linux kernel, also FreeBSD. 
## Images
Various ready-to-use images, created by various parties, are provided on the Pine64 [Software Software Release Wiki page][44375]. 
## BSP
A Linux kernel v4.9 based [BSP SDK][44376] was provided by Allwinner. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][44377] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
Use the _pine64-lts_defconfig_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
Use the _sun50i-a64-pine64-lts.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The board has no dedicated FEL button. Out of the box with no SD card inserted the board will go into FEL mode. A bootable image on the SPI flash or on the eMMC module will prevent that. An SD card image with a magic FEL image will force FEL mode, regardless of eMMC or SPI flash content. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.
# Serial port / UART
[![][44378]][44379]
[][44380]
Pine64 UART pads
The debug UART 0 is exposed both on the 10-pin EXP connector as well as on the 34-pin Euler connector. Refer to the picture on the right to find the pins. The location is the same as on the [ Pine64 board][44381].
