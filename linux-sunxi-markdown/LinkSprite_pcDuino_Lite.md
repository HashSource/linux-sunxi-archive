### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
At the time of writing, there is no pcDuino Lite dts in Linux, but when using the **sun4i-a10-pcduino.dts** device-tree file of the [mainline kernel][31630], many peripheral work out of the box. 
Status with linux-libre 5.3.1-gnu-1 in Parabola: 
  * microSD works: booted with the rootfs on it
  * Ethernet works
  * The two USB host port work: tested with an USB key
