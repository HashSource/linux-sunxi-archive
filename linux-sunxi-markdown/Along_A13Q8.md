# Identification
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    AL-A13Q8-V8_5
    REV:8.5
    2013.08.07
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _DEVICE_
  * Build Number: _SOC_BOARD_DEVICE_*.*_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Give a brief overview of the current status of support under sunxi here. If there is mainline support for either U-Boot or kernel, mention this too, but add the extra sections below.
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building U-Boot, use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][7056]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][7057]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Volume- button triggers [ FEL mode][7058]. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
There are no UART pads available on this device. You will have to use the [MicroSD Breakout adapter][7059]. 
## Device disassembly
See [the Q8 tablet format disassembly page][7060]. 
## Locating the UART
Pins 151 and 152 of the TQFP do not seem to be wired up. You might get away with attaching a very very thin wire to it, but that requires some very creative soldering. 
# Pictures
