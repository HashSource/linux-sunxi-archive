# Identification
There is nothing printed on the back of the device in the rectangle designed for it. There is "TBS" and logo on the front side. 
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    A711 A83T V2.0
    2016.01.20
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: Octopus A83 F1
  * Build Number: octopus_a711-eng

# Sunxi support
## Current status
The device is supported. 
## Manual build
Support in the community maintained sunxi-3.4 kernel is not planned. 
Fex file patch was sent to the mailing list ([https://www.mail-archive.com/[email protected]/msg21573.html][53332]). 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Device was originally shipped with u-boot-2011.09. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Supported since 2018.01. 
Devicetree source: sun8i-a83t-tbs-a711.dts 
Defconfig: tbs_a711_defconfig 
Working branch was: <https://github.com/tbs-biometrics/u-boot-a711/tree/tbs/2017.07>
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Allwinner kernel 3.4.39 was used. 
#### Mainline kernel
Starting 4.15 there is _sun8i-a83t-tbs-a711.dts_ devicetree source in mainline. 
Working branch for basic support: <https://github.com/tbs-biometrics/linux-a711/tree/tbs/4.13>
Working branch for CSI support: <https://github.com/megous/linux/tree/linux-tbs>
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## LCD and touch issues
There were a few revisions of the board. The changes were in the LCD timing (timing changes just in the fex file) and a touchscreen configuration (`ctp_exchange_x_y_flag` and `ctp_revert_*_flag` were inverted). 
## FEL mode
There is a footprint labeled UBOOT on the board. It is located near the CPU. It is not tested but it should be usable to go into the [ FEL mode][53333]. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

[][53336]
TBS A711 UART connector
There is an easily accessible UART receptacle on the board (you need to disassemble the tablet to access them). 
## Device disassembly
  1. There are four screws on the sides of the tablet. Unscrew them.
  2. You need to pop the pins to remove the back side. [Plastic tool][53337] is very helpful.

## Locating the UART
UART recetacle is labeled UART0 and it is located near the soldering pads for vibrator. It operates at 3 V. See the image for the pin assignment and [UART howto][53338] for more information.

# Miscellaneous
Some tablets were donated to the community. The number of tablets for community is limited now (this may change in the future). See [https://www.mail-archive.com/[email protected]/msg21568.html][53348].
