# Identification
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: A727
  * Build Number: A23_86DZ_D701C_131174.20131229

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Like all things A23, this hardware is not supported. It is however a prime target for development. For more information, check [ the Allwinner A23 SoC page][26313]. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][26332]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][26333]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Volume +/- buttons trigger [ FEL mode][26334]. Unfortunately, FEL mode via this method appears to be useless for dumping device info. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

Inez 86dz UART pads
## Device disassembly
Unscrew 2 small screws on the button panel side. Using a [plastic tool][26338] pop out the sides and pull off the cover. 
## Locating the UART
The test pad nearest to the right side of the SD slot is serial TX. Tx is multiplexed with pin mmc pin 0, so expect to see garbage when using an SD card. 
Rx hasn't been found yet (Neither front nor back test pads nor uSD slot pins). Read-only console for now.
