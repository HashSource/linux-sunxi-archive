# Identification
Apart from a _Jesurun_ sticker, there are no external markings. 
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    AVM STV301 MB V1.1
    2012.07.16
[/code]
Find out the strings as reported under settings.
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _DEVICE_
  * Build Number: _SOC_BOARD_DEVICE_*.*_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
U-boot-sunxi and linux-sunxi are supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the _jesurun_q5_defconfig_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [sys_config/a10/jesurun-q5.fex][29102]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][29103]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
For [ building mainline u-boot][29104], use the _jesurun_q5_defconfig_ target. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the _sun4i-a10-jesurun-q5.dts_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][29105]. 
**NOTE** : submitting patch is WIP (2015-02-26) 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
There is a solder mask for a button on the board that might trigger [ FEL mode][29106], but it is not populated. 
## Mainline U-Boot: HDMI hotplug detection does not work
Workaround: 
  * Manually set video mode and disable hot-plug detection

[code] 
    sunxi# setenv video-mode sunxi:1280x720-24@60,hpd=0
[/code]
  * Make env variable persistent:

[code] 
    sunxi# saveenv
[/code]
Verify: Check video-mode env variable: 
[code] 
    sunxi# printenv video-mode
       video-mode=sunxi:1280x720-24@60,hpd=0
[/code]
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

UART pads
## Device disassembly
This casing is trivially disassembled by removing 4 Philips screws on the bottom. 
## Locating the UART
The UART pads are clearly marked on the top of the board. You can solder in a 2.54mm pitch header as shown in the picture, or you can solder on wires directly. For more information read our [UART howto][29110].
