# Identification
On the back of the board, _XW-MINIPC-I9_ is printed. 
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: I9
  * Kernel Version 3.0.8+ hzj@Exdroid #9 Thu Dec 13 12:07:24 CST 2012
  * Build Number: elite_evb-eng 4.0.4 IMM76D 20121213 test-keys

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported, apart from the unidentified wifi. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "Auxtek-T004" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [auxtek-t004.fex][8090]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][8091]. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the _sun5i-a10s-auxtek-t004.dts_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][8092]. 
  

# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The button marked _uboot_ , right next to the serial port, triggers [ FEL mode][8093].

Unidentified Wifi module
## Wifi
The wifi chip, marked _W01_ _TOC9002_ _1237_ still is a bit of a puzzler. Perhaps powering the USB bus and then running lsusb will reveal what's in there. 
## Debugging help
For building the kernel set the options: 
  * EARLY_PRINTK enabled
  * SW_DEBUG_UART configured to 0

Pass earlyprintk on your bootargs. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

T004 UART pads
## Device disassembly
With a [plastic tool][8100] it is very easy to remove the top lid How exactly?. 
## Locating the UART
There are two pads between the SoC and the u-boot button. Just solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][8101].
