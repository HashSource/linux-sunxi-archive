# Sunxi support
## Current status
U-boot and mainline kernel support is being worked on. 
## BSP
BSP is available at <http://d.myirtech.com/MYD-YT113X/>
## Manual build
### U-Boot
Mainline u-boot is Being worked on, based on Andre's T113 patchset. 
### Linux Kernel
Being worked on. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
The DEBUG (J4) can be jumpered at JP2 and JP3 to use ttyS0 or ttyS5. Default is ttyS5. If ttyS0 is jumpered, booting from MMC will not work. 
The ethernet PHY is a Motorcomm YT8531SH, which is mainly used on the StarFive VisionFive 2 board. There is no support in mainline u-boot for this PHY yet. 
## Locating the UART
Located at J4 DEBUG connector.
