# Identification
KB901 V1.1 is printed onto the board. 
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: DEVICE
  * Build Number: SOC_BOARD_DEVICE_*.*

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Give a brief overview of the current status of support under sunxi here. If there is mainline support for either u-boot or kernel, mention this too, but add the extra sections below.
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][46350]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][46351]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][46352]. 
Currently only UART FEL has been tested. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
[![][46353]][46354]

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][46356].
## Device disassembly
Provide a short description of how to open the device. Explain how the pins can be most easily popped, and mention the [Plastic tool howto][46357].
Cover could be opened on the bottom where two screws are seated. You have to remove those screws first. 
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][46356].
UART pads are seated near the camera and labeled GND/TX/RX.
