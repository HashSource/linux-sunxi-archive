## Current status
TODO 
  * find the accelerometer on the pcb :)

You can boot uboot/linux with this device and the basic things are working. I'm using here Arch Linux ARM. 
  

Hardware | mainline linux | Note   
---|---|---  
v1.1 | v1.2   
CPUfreq | working | working   
LCD | no | no | works, but not good (colorless, less gamma), needs probably an init sequence (see here: [starry768x1024.c][25212], this module is used by the Android OS)   
Backlight | working | working   
Touchscreen | not tested yet | working | needs firmware "gsl1680e_101.fw" extraxted from gslX680new.ko, using ts_uinput from [tslib][25213]  
W-LAN | rtl8723bs   
working | rtl8723cs   
not tested yet | rtl8723bs is in staging since linux-4.12 (also a firmware is needed) / rtl8723cs is available out of tree   
Bluetooth | not tesetd yet | not tested yet |   
Sound | not tested yet | not tested yet |   
## Images
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][25204]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be removed.
## HW-Pack
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi HW-pack specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## BSP
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi BSP specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][25214] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][25215] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The Volume+ button triggers [ FEL mode][25216]. Verify with sunxi-fel: 
[code] 
    sunxi-fel -l
    USB device 008:010   Allwinner A33     0461872a:035400c2:9ab76905:00000000
    
    sunxi-fel version

UART0 on iRULU X11 V1.1
There are UART pads available on this device, but they are not tested and probably multiplexed with the microSD adapter. 
## Device disassembly
This can easily be done with a [Plastic tool][25220] or a sharp fingernail. 
## Locating the UART
[UART][25221] is located next to the CPU [A33][25171].
