This page needs to be properly filled according to the [New Device Howto][44091] and the [New Device Page guide][44092].
If a device is special, then feel free to provide a terse description of what makes this device so special. But terse, no novels, no marketing blurb.
The A80 Pcduino8 Board is the first commercially available board for the Allwinner [A80][44088] SoC. For most parts the Pcduino8 board is identical to the [Merrii A80 Optimus Board][44093], however this one has NAND IC instead of EMMC.

# Identification
The board has a clearly recognizable Pcduino beta label on it, and its white, a common PCB overlay color for all Pcduino products. 
  
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: UltraOcta A80 OptimusBoard (Its not a mistake. It actually reports a different board as the model)
  * Build Number: KOT49H

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Not supported yet. 
## Images
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][44111]
## HW-Pack
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE HW-pack specifics here.
## BSP
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE BSP specifics here.
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][44113]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][44114]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
Not supported yet. 
## Mainline kernel
Not supported yet. 
If there is mainline kernel support, add this section.
Use the FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][44115]. 
Don't forget to add

FEL mode yet to be found on the Pcduino8, one button acts as hard-reset, other one as power key(used in Android) 
## Android
It comes with Android 4.4.2 KOT49H, and 3.4 based kernel.
