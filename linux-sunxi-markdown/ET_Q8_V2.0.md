# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    The PCB has the following written on it:
    ET_Q8_V2.0
    151121
    
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: Q88
  * Build Number: astar_rtl8703-eng 4.4.2 KVT49L 20151229 test-keys

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Mainline U-boot OK from SD. 
Mainline Kernel OK from SD. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][17620]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][17621]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
Use 2016.11 with default A33 1024x600. 
**q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig** file 
## Mainline kernel
Use the _sun8i-a33-et-q8.dts_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][17622]. With USB host mode only work with every type of cables. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Volume+ button triggers [ FEL mode][17623]. 
## Retrieving script.bin
Unlike, other allwinner devices,Script.bin is not present in the vfat partition(nanda) as file. 
Instead, It is located 0x43000000, it's size is 0x00020000. _script.bin_ can be extracted from /dev/mem using mmap() or sunxi-tools _firmware_extractor_. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
There are no UART pads available on this device. Instead, UART0 is multiplexed with the microSD adapter. Please refer to the [MicroSD Breakout adapter][17624] for more information..
