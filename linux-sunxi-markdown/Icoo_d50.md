# Identification
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: A13-EVB
  * Build Number: nuclear_D50_sc3038n-eng 4.0.4 IMM76D 20120801 test-keys

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Awaiting patches. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "Icoo_d50" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [icoo_d50.fex][25420]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][25421]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The home/back button triggers [ FEL mode][25422]. There is also a hard [FEL][25422] button labelled _Boot_ behind the hole for the microphone. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

UART pads
## Device disassembly
The back cover needs to be gently pushed outwards with your [Plastic Tool][25426]. Be careful though, as the LCD and Touchpanel ribbons are short. 
## Locating the UART
On the back of the PCB, there are pads labelled "RX" and "TX". All you have to do is solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][25427].
