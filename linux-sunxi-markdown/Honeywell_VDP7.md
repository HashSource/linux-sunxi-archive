# Sunxi support
## Current status
The device is currently not supported by default by uboot or the Linux kernel 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][24143] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
Use the following config with minimal own created A64 dts-files: 
[code] 
    CONFIG_ARM=y
    CONFIG_ARCH_SUNXI=y
    CONFIG_SPL=y
    CONFIG_MACH_SUN50I=y
    CONFIG_RESERVE_ALLWINNER_BOOT0_HEADER=y
    CONFIG_DRAM_ODT_EN=y
    CONFIG_MMC0_CD_PIN=""
    CONFIG_MMC_SUNXI_SLOT_EXTRA=2
    CONFIG_SPL_SPI_SUNXI=y
    CONFIG_DEFAULT_DEVICE_TREE="sun50i-a64-vdp7" # Currently missing
    CONFIG_DM_REGULATOR=y
    CONFIG_DM_REGULATOR_FIXED=y
    CONFIG_DM_PWM=y
    CONFIG_PWM_SUNXI=y
    # CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_CLEAR_ON_INIT is not set
    # CONFIG_CMD_FLASH is not set
    # CONFIG_SPL_DOS_PARTITION is not set
    # CONFIG_SPL_EFI_PARTITION is not set
    CONFIG_USB_EHCI_HCD=y
    CONFIG_SYS_USB_EVENT_POLL_VIA_INT_QUEUE=y
[/code]
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][24144] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Emergency button on the right side triggers the [ FEL mode][24145]. The corresponding USB OTG is available on the extension board connector J4 and has the following pin out: 
  1. VBUS
  2. DM
  3. DP
  4. USB-ID
  5. GND

## LVDS-Display
Is connected over LVDS pins PD12-PD21 on LCD2 connector. 
## Device disassembly
Remove the back 4 screws. There is a hole on the bottom back housing were a screw driver could be placed to open it. 
## Power Supply (J3)
The assembled connector J3 in the near of the network jack is for the 12V power supply and has the following pin out: 
  1. +12V
  2. GND

## Locating the UART0 (J6)
There is a not assembled connector J6 marked on the right extension board which is connected to UART0 and has the following pin out: 
  1. GND
  2. TX
  3. VCC
  4. RX

## Locating the UART3/4 (CON2)
The connector CON2 has 2 RS485 UARTs connected. 
  1. DBEL
  2. GND
  3. UART3-A
  4. UART3-B
  5. UART4-A
  6. UART4-B

## Locating the USB-OTG (J4)
There is a not assembled connector J4 marked on the right extension board which is connected to USB0 and has the following pin out: 
  1. VBUS
  2. DM
  3. DP
  4. ID
  5. GND
