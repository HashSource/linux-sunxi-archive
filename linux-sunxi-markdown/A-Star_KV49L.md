# Identification
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    M102_MB V1.0
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _QUAD-CORE A33 y3_
  * Build Number: _astar-y3-eng 4.4.2 KVT49L_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
None currently, [A33][211] is not supported yet. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][237] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][238]file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][239]. 
## Retrieving script.bin
Unlike older Allwinner devices, this device only has some basic images on the nanda partition. This means that u-boot and script.bin are living elsewhere. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

DEVICE UART pads
## Device disassembly
The device has no screws, the cover is 'clicked' on the screen. A suction cup and a little wiggling with the soft back shell quickly and easily removes the rear cover. You might want to use a [Plastic tool][243] as well. 
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][244].
