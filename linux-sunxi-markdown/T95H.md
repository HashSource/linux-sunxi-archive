# Sunxi support
## Current status
Not yet supported, but U-Boot and kernel support WIP. Since it uses the AC200 integrated 100MBit Ethernet PHY, it relies on pending mainline support for the chip to have working Ethernet. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][53250] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### Mainline U-Boot
### Mainline Linux Kernel
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The button on the top of the PCB triggers [ FEL mode][53251] mode (to be confirmed). It is reachable through the CVBS connector.. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.

T95H UART pads
To get access to the UART pads, you have to open the box. 
## Device disassembly
To open up the case, the pins can be easily popped with a thin screw driver or the [Plastic tool howto][53255]. 
## Locating the UART
The UART pads are located on the bottom left of the device PCB, between USB 0 the sdcard socket, providing RX, TX and GND signals, as pictured. The assignment is printed next to it. To solder some wires or pins, just remove the PCB (three screws). To route the wires outside the case, you could drill a small hole anywhere to the right on the pcb where there is an empty space in the case. Once done, follow the [UART howto][53256].
