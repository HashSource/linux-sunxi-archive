# Identification
This section explains how to most easily identify your device. For a development board, explain the name(s) printed on the board. For an android device, find out the strings as reported under settings.
It seems as if the design for the A70x was sold to many different manufacturers. It presents as a number of different brands, the original designer seems difficult to determine. Some have also tweaked the design adding bluetooth support or switching to the [A23][4181] chip. As a successful device other manufacturers have also started marketing completely different products as the A70x. 
A few manufacturers found: 
[code] 
    * [Accessory Plus][4182]
    * [Shenzhen Qual Technology][4183]
    * [Shenzhen Reborn Technology][4184]
    
[/code]
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    Manufacturer Marketing Name
    ModelNumber
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    LIA-BB-V6.66
    1970-01-01
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _A70X_
  * Build Number: _A70X 4.2.2 JDQ39 20131119 release-keys_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Not supported as u-boot patch is missing. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][4185] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_a70x.fex_][4186] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The rear button triggers [ FEL mode][4187]. 
You need UART connected, Send "2" over the serial link, by holding down "2" on your keyboard. 
## Meminfo
Running a10-meminfo-static returned: 
[code] 
    dram_clk          = 360
    dram_type         = 3
    dram_rank_num     = 1
    dram_chip_density = 2048
    dram_io_width     = 16
    dram_bus_width    = 32
    dram_cas          = 9
    dram_zq           = 0x12b73b7f
    dram_odt_en       = 0
    dram_tpr0         = 0x42d899b7
    dram_tpr1         = 0xa090
    dram_tpr2         = 0x22a00
    dram_tpr3         = 0x0
    dram_emr1         = 0x4
    dram_emr2         = 0x10
    dram_emr3         = 0x0
    
[/code]
But no patch was apparently ever sent into the mailing list. 
## I2C pads
The pads circled in yellow are in slightly different positions on some later versions of the board. They are sometimes screen printed SCK and SDA- Possibly i2c?

A70x UART pads
## Device disassembly
Insert your [plastic tool][4191] between the front and back covers, and push the back cover outwards, you should soon hear the clips pop. Start at the corner nearest the loudspeaker. 
## Locating the UART
The UART pads are located next to the SOC. Solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][4192]. 
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][4193], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
