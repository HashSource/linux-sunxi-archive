# Identification
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: SoftwinnerEvb
  * Kernel-Version: 3.0.8 qliu00@semitime #6 Mon Dec 10:44:01 CST 2012
  * Build Number: elite_nm307_v11-eng 4.0.4 IMMQ76D 20121210 test-keys

Incidentally, that's the same android image that is running on the [Semitime g2][35801]. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "Megafeis_A08" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [megafeis_a08.fex][35802]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][35803]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The is a UBoot button which triggers [ FEL mode][35804]. You can reach it through a hole in the case, left, about in the middle of the top cover of the device. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

DEVICE UART pads
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped.
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][35808].
There are 3 obvious pads below the SoC. Two of them are bound to be RX and TX. See the [UART howto][35808] for more information on determining which is which, and how to solder on some wires. 
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][35809], and add them here.
