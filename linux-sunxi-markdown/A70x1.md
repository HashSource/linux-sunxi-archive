# Identification
This section explains how to most easily identify your device. For a development board, explain the name(s) printed on the board. For an android device, find out the strings as reported under settings.
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    Manufacturer Marketing Name
    ModelNumber
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    A70X1_V2
    2013-09-26
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _A70X_
  * Build Number: _wing_k70-eng 4.2.2 JDQ39 20130906 test-keys_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
There is neither u-boot defconfig neither dts yet. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building U-Boot, use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][4273]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][4274]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
If there is mainline U-Boot support, add this section.
For [ building mainline U-Boot][4275], use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target. 
Don't forget to add 
[code]
    [[Category:Mainline_U-Boot]]
[/code]
at the bottom of the page.
## Mainline kernel
If there is mainline kernel support, add this section.
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][4276]. 
Don't forget to add 
[code]
    [[Category:Mainline_Kernel]]
[/code]
at the bottom of the page.
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][4277]. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.
## TS Hacking
[![][4278]][4279]
[][4280]
TC pads
There is no upstream support for the [GSL1680][4281] touch-screen controller, interested people can connect some probe on the PCB to hack it.

# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
[![][4282]][4283]
[][4284]
UART pads
## Device disassembly
Insert your [plastic tool][4285] between the front and back covers, and push the back cover outwards, you should soon hear the clips pop. Start at the corner nearest the loudspeaker. 
## Locating the UART
The UART pads are located next to the SOC, the TX and RX pin are marked on the PCB. Solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][4286].
