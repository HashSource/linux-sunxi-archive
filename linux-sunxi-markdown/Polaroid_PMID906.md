# Identification
  * Model Number: PMID900
  * Build Number: 05.01.001.004.11

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Give a brief overview of the current status of support under sunxi here.
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][45480]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][45481]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][45482].

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][45486]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
See [the Q8 tablet format disassembly page][45487]. 
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][45486].
