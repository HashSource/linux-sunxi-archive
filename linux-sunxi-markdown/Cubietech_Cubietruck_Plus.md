# Identification
The board helpfully states "CUBIETRUCK PLUS". 
According to Cubieboard's resources repository, there are 2 versions: v1.0 and v1.1. Cubietech states that all retail pieces are v1.1. 
# Sunxi support
The board is supported by both mainline U-Boot and kernels. 
## Current status
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][15392] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **Cubietruck_plus_defconfig** build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun8i-a83t-cubietruck-plus.dtb** device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The UBOOT button forces boot from mmc0, and drops to [ FEL mode][15393] if no boot signature is found. 
## Display Port
This board has a DP output, supported with a Toshiba TC358777XBG MIPI DSI - DP bridge. With Cubietech's images, one must switch out the FEX files to use DP instead of HDMI. This bridge chip is controlled via I2C. 
## SATA
The SATA port is not native SATA. It is supported by a GL830 USB 2.0 to SATA bridge. This chip is connected directly to the SoC's USB host. 
## USB 2.0 Hosts
Since the only USB 2.0 host is connected to the SATA bridge chip, the board has a SMSC USB3053 USB 2.0 HSIC hub chip, providing 2x Type-A USB host ports on the board.  
This USB3053 chip is controlled via I2C. Linux mainline kernel provides a driver ("usb3053") for it.  
1x OTG MicroUSB 
## Acrylic Case
The board comes with an plastic case, which is just 3 pieces of acrylic screwed together with the board using spacers. The screw holes on these are not very accurate, so one might not be able to do a complete assembly. 
## Possible software issues
If you're using Cubietech's OS image and processes get sigkilled when run under UID != 0 check the contents of _/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr_. If it's [65536][15394] then try to decrease the value to 32678 or even 4096 and see whether that helps. 
## CPU Heating issues
The A83/H8 absolutely needs a heatsink, active cooling is heavily recommended, otherwise the CPU will lower max frequency or even stop using cores. 
# Adding a serial port
## Locating the UART

DEVICE UART pads
There is a nice 0.1" connector behind the USB ports Just attach some leads according to our [UART howto][15398].
