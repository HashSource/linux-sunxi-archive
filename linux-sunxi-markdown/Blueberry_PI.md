# Sunxi support
## Current status
No sunxi support now, but there's some WIP code. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **LicheePi_Zero_defconfig** (supported since v2017.05) build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun8i-v3s-licheepi-zero.dtb**. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
When the on-board flash is empty, just remove the MicroSD to enter FEL mode. 
## Locating the UART
Since the Blueberry PI has a 26pin Raspberry PI compatible Header, the UART0 port is located at the same place as on the Raspberry PI.
