This device was [imported and rebranded][44159] under the PengPod 1000 name by Peacock Imports, who was secretive about where they had bought them. 
Although it comes in the same case as [Inet_1][44160], the board differs slightly.

# Identification
Apart from the names and symbols explaining the buttons, the back of the device is blank. It came with a small sticker proclaiming "N500c", indicating that it _may_ have been a Wayestar device. 
The following is silkscreened on the underside of the PCB:

In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: BC1077
  * Kernel Version: 3.0.8+ jackie@ubuntu #50 Mon Nov5 09:51:29 CST 2012
  * Build Number: crane_bc1077-eng 4.0.4 IMM76D 20121108 test-keys

# Sunxi support
## Current status
pengpod1000 can be found in [boards.cfg][44179], but not much else. However, it is (as mentioned earlier) very similiar to the [Point of View Protab 2 XXL][44160]
## Images
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][44177]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be left blank.
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building U-Boot, use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target.
  * The .fex file can (not yet) be found in sunxi-boards
  * It can be found at [this temporary location][44180]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][44181]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
## Mainline kernel
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
It may need the same changes to fully support FT5X as mentioned on the [Inet_1][44160] page. 
## FEL mode
There is a button between power connector and Mini USB connector which supposedly triggers [ FEL mode][44182].

DEVICE UART pads
  

## Device disassembly
By removing the two screws on the connector side, the device is trivially opened. 
## Locating the UART
There are some marked UART pads in a corner of the board, near the type-A usb socket, where you'd need to solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][44186].
