# Sunxi support
## Current status
Give a brief overview of the current status of support under sunxi here. If there is mainline support for either u-boot or kernel, mention this too, but add the extra sections below.
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the _jesurun_a19_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [jesurun_a19.fex][29021]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][29022]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][29027]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][29028].
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][29027].
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][29029], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
