This is an obvious [Rikomagic MK802+][49084] clone, but it contains an [A10s][49082] SoC instead. It is not clear whether it was ever sold by Rikomagic itself, or whether it was only marketed by third parties.

# Identification
This device is clearly marked as an MK802+ on the case, and is often sold as such. It however has 1GB of RAM and an A10s chip inside. The paper manual mentions "AK-212MinPC". The board is marked as "ST-G2", together with the kernel version strings, this led us to the manufacturer. 
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: SoftwinnerEvb
  * Kernel-Version: 3.0.8 qliu00@semitime #6 Mon Dec 10:44:01 CST 2012
  * Build Number: elite_nm307_v11-eng 4.0.4 IMMQ76D 20121210 test-keys

Incidentally, that's the same android image that is running on the [ Megafeis A08][49101]. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "Semitime_G2" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [semitime_g2.fex][49102]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][49103]. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the _sun5i-a10s-mk802.dts_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][49104]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
There is a special button to trigger [ FEL mode][49105]. You can reach it through the bottom-left hole of the top cover of the device. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
[![][49106]][49107]
[][49108]
Bad routing: Not a UART!
## Device disassembly
The three piece case is clicked together. Do not try to get the semi-transparent bit around the USB Host connector off, as it is clipped into the top and you could damage the clip. Just gently push your [plastic tool][49109] between the bottom and the top, and push the top part of the shell outwards. You will soon hear the clips release. 
## Locating the UART
On the board labelled **VER:1.0** , due to bad routing, the two pads which were meant to be the [UART][49110] instead turned out to be PB11 and PB14, rendering them useless. You will have to resort to a [MicroSD breakout board][49111] to get serial on this device.

# Also known as
  * It is often branded as an A10s based [MK802+][49084], but it just shares the external packaging and has MK802+ written on the top cover.
