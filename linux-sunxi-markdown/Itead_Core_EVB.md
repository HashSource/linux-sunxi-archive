# Sunxi support
## Current status
This device runs both mainline and legacy u-boot as well as mainline & legacy kernels. 
## Images
No sunxi images available from ITEAD 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][28286] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][28287] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Networking is flaky. Specifically - on some power-ups - the device does not request an address over DHCP, and rebooting / `dhcpcd eth0` does not fix this situation. Only a power cycle seems to work. However, booting with UART0 connected (especially with the device's RCV & GND connected) seems to make this work 100% of the time. 
## FEL mode
The _FEL_ button triggers [ FEL mode][28288]. 
## UART
UART-0 is available via pins on the J4 (32 pin) side connector.

DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][28292]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
