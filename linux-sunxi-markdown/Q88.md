# Identification
This section explains how to most easily identify your device. For a development board, explain the name(s) printed on the board. For an android device, find out the strings as reported under settings.
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: DEVICE
  * Build Number: SOC_BOARD_DEVICE_*.*

## Retrieved by other means
  * Name in build.prop: A13-MID
  * Product name: nuclear-pfdq88
  * Device name: nuclear
  * Board name: Q88

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code.
## HW-Pack
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE HW-pack specifics here.
## BSP
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE BSP specifics here.
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][46188]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][46189]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats

DEVICE UART pads
## Device disassembly
See [the Q8 tablet format disassembly page][46194]. 
## Locating the UART
There are two pads between the SoC and the SD slot. They might be multiplexed with the SD-Card. On the v1.2 board, the left pad is RX and the right pad is TX. Attach some wires according to our [UART howto][46195].
