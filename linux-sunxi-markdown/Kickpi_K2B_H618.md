# Identification
This section explains how to most easily identify your device. For a development board, explain the name(s) printed on the board. For an android device, find out the strings as reported under settings.
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    Manufacturer Marketing Name
    ModelNumber
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    LIA-BB-V6.66
    1970-01-01
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _DEVICE_
  * Build Number: _SOC_BOARD_DEVICE_*.*_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Not currently supported due to DT missing, but schematic available. 
## Images
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][29569]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be removed.
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][29571] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Mainline Linux Kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][29572]. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.
