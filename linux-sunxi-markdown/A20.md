Allwinner A20 (sun7i) SoC features a Dual-Core Cortex-A7 ARM CPU, and a [Mali400][2878] MP2 GPU from ARM. 
Allwinner A20 is a low-end (budget) version of the [A31][2880]. It shares its Cortex-A7 ARM CPU architecture, but at the same time it is also pin-to-pin compatible with [A10][2881]. 
A20 is fully supported by the community from linux-sunxi 3.4 kernel and later.

# Overview
A20 CPU consists of dual ARM Cortex-A7 cores, and integrates the Mali400 MP2 GPU. Together with [Cedar Engine][2896] multimedia processing unit that is capable of up to 2160p (3840x1080@30fps 4k resolution or 1080p 3D decoding) video decoding, with integrated HDMI 1.4 output support, and H.264 HP (High Profile) in 1080p at 30fps video encoding. 
## Main components of the A20
  * CPU: Dual-Core ARM [Cortex-A7 1GHz Processor (r0p4, revidr=0x0)][2897] which have both VFP4 and NEON SIMD co-processors that share 32 floating point double-precision registers together[[1]][2898]: 
    * FPU: standard ARM VFPv4-D32 FPU Floating Point Unit
    * SIMD: NEON (ARM's extended general-purpose SIMD vector processing extension engine)
  * GPU: [Mali400 MP2][2878]
  * VPU: [Cedar Engine][2896] (Video Processor Unit for audio and video hardware decoding or encoding)
  * HDMI-transmitter: HDMI CEC (Consumer Electronics Control)

## Cortex-A7
Cortex-A7 is 100% ISA compatible with the Cortex-A15, this includes the new virtualization instructions, integer divide support and 40-bit memory addressing. Any code running on an A15 can run on a Cortex A7, just slower. This is a very important feature as it enables SoC vendors to build chips with both Cortex A7 and Cortex A15 cores, switching between them depending on workload requirements. ARM calls this a big.LITTLE configuration.[[2]][2899][[3]][2900][[4]][2901]
### Virtualization
Cortex A7 and A15 includes hardware virtualization support. 
  * It is managed by Xen ([Presentation of Cortex A7 and A15 capabilities for virtualisation][2902], [Xen ARM][2903] on xenproject.org, [PVH mode][2904] on blog.xen.org, [Xen ARMv7 with Virtualization Extensions][2905] on xenproject.org wiki)

  * [there is a guide about running xen on a20][2906]

  * [Some guides to deploy virtualization on Cortex-A15 and source for virtualization with KVM on Cortex-A15 on github][2907]

  * [Open Kernel Labs Delivers OKL4 Mobile Virtualization for ARM Cortex-A7 Processors][2908]

On the kvm branch of kernel.org, there is description of Cortex-A15 Virtualization extensions VGIC registers : 
  * [GIC of ARM on kvm branch of the kernel][2909]

After the ARM Cortex-A7 documentation: 
  * GIC memory MAP on Cortex-A7[[5]][2910]:

[code] 
    0x4000-0x4FFF	Virtual interface control, common base address
    0x5000-0x5FFF	Virtual interface control, processor-specific base address
    0x6000-0x7FFF	Virtual CPU interface
    
[/code]
  * Virtual Maintenance Interrupt (PPI6)[[6]][2911]
  * 2 virtual interrupt signals, nVIRQ and nVFIQ[[7]][2912]
  * With MMU-400, Intermediate Physical Address (IPA) ca be used by guest OS[[8]][2913]
