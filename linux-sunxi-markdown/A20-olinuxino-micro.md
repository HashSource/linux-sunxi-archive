A20-OLinuXino-Micro is fully [OSHW][2789] [A20][2787] based development board from our friends at [Olimex][2790]. 
This board was [originally designed][2791] with the pin-compatible [A10][2792] in mind. While this design never shipped, Olimex can produce [A10][2792] versions of this board if you so desire.

# Identification
The board helpfully reads "A20-OLINUXINO-MICRO". 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][2814] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [a20-olinuxino_micro.fex][2815]
  * There are also several fex files dealing with the different LCDs in [the same directory][2816].

#### Mainline U-Boot
  * For building U-boot, use the **A20-OLinuXino_MICRO_defconfig** target.
  * There is another U-boot target for the eMMC version, **A20-OLinuXino_MICRO-eMMC_defconfig**.

### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun7i-a20-olinuxino-micro.dtb** device-tree binary. See [mainline kernel][2817]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The recovery button triggers [ FEL mode][2818]. 
## LCD Modules
See the [ Olimex LCD Modules][2819] page for more information on how to attach and set up Olimex LCD panels on this hardware. 
## Expansion Ports
This board has multiple expansion ports: 
  * `GPIO-1 / LCD_CON` \- compatible with 4.3", 7.0", 10.1" LCD modules from Olimex, can also be used for general GPIO support.
  * `GPIO-2`, `GPIO-3`, `GPIO-4` \- general GPIO support
  * `UEXT1` and `UEXT2`

# Adding a serial port
[![][2820]][2821]
[][2822]
UART0 pins
There is a clearly marked UART on the top of the device. All you have to do is connect some wires according to our [UART howto][2823]. 
[![Exclamation-red.png][2824]][2825] **Warning: Do no connect the _3.3V_ pin. This could damage your board.**
