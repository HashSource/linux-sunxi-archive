# Sunxi support
## Current status
**Not Supported**
## Images
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][60717]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be removed.
## HW-Pack
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi HW-pack specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## BSP
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi BSP specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][60719] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Only useful for A10/A10s/A13 and A20 based devices. Remove this section otherwise.
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Only useful for A10/A10s/A13 and A20 based devices. Remove this section otherwise.
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][60720] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Expansion ports
The OrangePi 4A has a 40-pin, 0.1" populated connector with several low-speed interfaces. 
The primary function follows loosely the Raspberry Pi pin assignment, but pinmuxing gives access to more interfaces (not all at the same time).

# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][60721]. 
## SPI booting
The board contains a 16MB SPI NOR flash chip, and the SoC can boot firmware from there. 
# Using serial port
Like with other Orange Pi boards, UART uses 3.3V signalling and is 5V tolerant so you can use any of the usual USB-UART dongles. UART pin header is easily accessible. 
## Locating the UART
The 3 UART pins are located adjacent to the power key and are clearly marked. You can use this serial port to log in or debug the system with a baud rate of **115200** , **8** data bits, **1** stop bit, **no** parity. Just attach some leads according to our [UART Howto][60722].
