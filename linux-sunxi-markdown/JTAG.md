[ÂµSD breakout][28870] showing 14pin JTAG connector
Initial notes: 
  * JTAG over Microsd
  * Below is default setup (A10) at boot! Bootloader etc may change it
  * Only tested with a microsd breakout board designed for a10
  * microsd breakout seems to have specific pull-ups/pull-downs in the board
  * I will test with direct connection to microsd pins later.
  * This has been tested on an MK802 only, but should theoretically work for everything.
  * This has been confirmed working on an A13 Tablet as well.

Microsd | Pin | JTAG Connection | 14-pin ARM JTAG Header   
---|---|---|---  
Data2 | 1 | TCK | 9   
Cmd | 3 | TDO | 11   
Data0 | 7 | TDI | 5   
Data1 | 8 | TMS | 7   
VDD | 4 | VTG | 1,13   
GND | 6 | GND |  2,3,4,6,8,10,12,14   
It is important to make sure boot0/boot1/u-boot/kernel doesn't pinmux this away, so nothing else must be using the pins. The script.bin needs to contain a correct jtag_para section. On my device, the default script.bin seems to contain an invalid configuration for the ports in question. Below is the configuration matching the working JTAG! 
[code] 
    [jtag_para]
    jtag_enable = 1
    jtag_ms = port:PF00<4><default><default><default>
    jtag_ck = port:PF05<4><default><default><default>
    jtag_do = port:PF03<4><default><default><default>
    jtag_di = port:PF01<4><default><default><default>

I used a Dangerous Prototypes Bus Blaster V2(.5) for my experiments (<http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Blaster>). I'm using the default buffer, which makes it jtagkey compatible. For now, i've only verified that both UrJTAG and OpenOCD can detect a device over the JTAG connection, but I haven't managed to read/write from memory yet or anything else fancy. 
Some output: UrJTAG detect:

Extremely work in progress OpenOCD cfg: 
[sun4i.cfg][28871]
Tested OpenOCD features: 
  * dumping memory (sun4i.cpu mdw commands)
  * halt & resuming
  * gdb 
    * Loading files (tested with fel-pio)
    * Single-stepping lines/instructions through loaded programs
    * Breakpoints
