MID S906 UART pads
## Device disassembly
Remove the two screws on the side with the connectors. 
Careful insert your [plastic tool][23528] in the space between the USB port and the back cover. Then, gently lead the tool to the edge toward the camera. You should soon hear the clips popping. Keep a plastic tool from edge to edge, while the back cover comes off. 
## Locating the UART
As shown, there are some small pads next to the SD slot. All you have to do is [solder on some wires][23529].
