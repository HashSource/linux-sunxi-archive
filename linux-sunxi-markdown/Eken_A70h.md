# Identification
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: A70H
  * Build Number: polaris_a70H-eng 4.2.2 JDQ39 20131228 test-keys

This image matches the android image used on the [ Ippo Q8H v2][17857], which has a different case design. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Like all things A23, this hardware is not supported. It is however a prime target for development. For more information, check [ the Allwinner A23 SoC page][17836]. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][17858]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][17859]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][17860]. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

DEVICE UART pads
## Device disassembly
Gently push the back cover outwards from the screen with your [plastic tool][17864]. You should soon feel the clips pop. When closing back up, replace the connector side first. 
## Locating the UART
Verify the information below according to our [UART howto][17865].
There are 2 pads right next to the SoC. The one closest to the SoC is RX/TX, the other is RX/TX. Attach some wires according to our [UART howto][17865].

# Also known as
This hardware is sold under many guises. If it is claimed to be an A13 tablet but with a 4.2.2 android, then chances are that it is an A23 one instead. 
Examples: 
  * P100
  * A20h
  * Eken A70H
  * Eken X73

These are frequently mentioned: 
  * A20x
  * [A70x][17877]
  * Q88 Pro

But likely they are [A70x][17877]. Note the micro HDMI port between the micro and normal USB ports on the [A70x][17877]
