# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    ANBERNIC
    Model No. RG35XX H
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    RG35XX H_V3.0

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Mainline support is work in progress. See the [RG35XX status][7388] for updates. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][7389] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Mainline Linux Kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
Booting with a USB-C cable connected to the USB-OTG port (DC/OTG at top of the device) without an SD card inserted triggers FEL mode. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

UART pads
The UART header is located between the left SDCARD and left speaker [UART howto][7393]
## Device disassembly
Remove the four Torx T6 screws from the rear case. There's a small gap between the back and the rest of the case, just use a pick to open it up. The L1/R1 and L2/R2 buttons may fall when you open the case, but they are simple to reinsert and don't have any springs. 
## Locating the UART
The UART pins are GND, TX, RX, GND.
