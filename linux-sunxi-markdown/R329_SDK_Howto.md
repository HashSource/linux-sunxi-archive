# R329 SDK Howto
This page walks you through building Allwinners own SDK for the [R329][46537] SoC. 
  
The original SDK as created by Allwinner was behind a registration wall, which includes a click-through disclaimer that is at odds with the GPL. We have [our own mirror on our server][46538], which is actually open, and this howto describes how to use it.
