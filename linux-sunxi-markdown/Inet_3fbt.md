# Identification
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    INET-3FBT-REV01
    2012-06-22
[/code]
In Android on the Kogan Agora, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _KATBL10A16DA_
  * Build Number: _KoganAgoraICS4.0_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported 
## Manual build
  * For building U-Boot, use the _INet_3FBT_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [inet_3fbt.fex][26175]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][26176]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## Power supply / Charging
This board has a separate barrel socket for a 5 V power supply, however it will also charge off the micro-USB "computer" port. 
## Reset button
There is a reset button next to the UART pads accessible through a hole in the back of the case. 
## FEL mode
The Vol+ (middle) button triggers [ FEL mode][26177]. 
Alternatively, an "U-Boot" pad is available on the PCB near the WiFi chip. (On the front at the top, to the left of the antenna connection) 
## WiFi
Wifi chip is part of a shared [Wifi][26178]/[Bluetooth][26179] module called _iNet i10 T0C601C_. This has a [Broadcom BCM40183][26157] chip embedded in it. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

iNet 3FBT UART pads
## Device disassembly
Remove two screws from the connector side. Carefully insert your [plastic tool][26183] between the metal back cover and the frame, and gently push the frame to the outside until the clips release. Go all around until all clips have release. 
Since the Kogan Agora tablet has the same case as the Eken A90 style tablets, [this youtube video might also help][26184]. 
Be careful when opening the device though, as the speakers are glued to the back cover. 
## Locating the UART
The UART pads are nicely silkscreened on the board, under the touchscreen cable, right next to the reset button. All you have to do is solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][26185].
