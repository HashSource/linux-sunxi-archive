# Identification
This section explains how to most easily identify your device. For a development board, explain the name(s) printed on the board. For an android device, find out the strings as reported under settings.
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    PINE_TAB-V1_1-20190617
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _DEVICE_
  * Build Number: _SOC_BOARD_DEVICE_*.*_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Currently supported by out-of-tree mainline Linux forks. 
## Images
[Prebuilt postmarketOS images][44758]
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][44759] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
As we currently do not have any specific U-Boot config for this device, Use the _pine64-lts_defconfig_ build target temporarily as a hack. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Currently not supported in mainline. 
Use the _sun50i-a64-pinetab.dtb_ device-tree binary in the downstream forked kernel at [[1]][44760]. 
## FEL mode
Use the fel-sdboot.sunxi file in sunxi-tools to enter FEL mode. 
# Adding a serial port
PineTabs have the serial port multiplexed with the audio jack, see [[2]][44761] for the pinout. 
There's a switch to switch audio jack between headphone and UART, located near the microSD slot. 
# Device disassembly
Use [Plastic tool][44762] to loose the plastic clips between the main body and the back cover. Finish this operation at the side that the keyboard pogo pins are located. 
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][44763], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
