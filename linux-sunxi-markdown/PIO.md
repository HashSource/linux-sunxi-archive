# PIO
PIO (**Programmed input/output**) is a method of transferring data between the CPU and a peripheral, such as for example a network interface controller or an ATA storage controller. 
# Overview
In general, programmed I/O happens when software running on the CPU uses instructions that access I/O address space to perform data transfers to or from an I/O device. This is in contrast to DMA (Direct Memory Access) transfers. 
The best known example of a PC device that uses programmed I/O is the ATA interface; however, this interface can also be operated in any of several DMA modes. Many older devices in a PC also use PIO, including legacy serial ports, legacy parallel ports when not in ECP mode, the PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, legacy MIDI and joystick ports, the interval timer, and older network interfaces.
