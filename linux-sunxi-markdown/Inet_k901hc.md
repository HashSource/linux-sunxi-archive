# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    i-INN
    PRO 9.0 Dual Core U Black
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    INET-K90-REV01
    Zeng-gc 2013-05-29
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _PRO 9.0 Dual Core U Black_
  * Build Number: _PRO_9.0_Dal_Core_U_Black.20130903_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Awaiting patches. Linux can be booted by using boot images for a20-olinuxino_micro with script.bin from the k901c's internal flash. The USB OTG port does not work though. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the _Inet_K901C_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [inet_k901hc.fex][27709]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][27710]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][27711]. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

K901C UART pads
## Device disassembly
Carefully insert your [Plastic tool][27715] between the front and back covers, and gently push the back cover outwards, until you hear the clips release. Go around the whole device. 
## Locating the UART
A set of clearly marked UART pads are available right next to the reset button and the SD-Card slot. All you have to do is solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][27716] but this is not comunicating 115200 N81.
