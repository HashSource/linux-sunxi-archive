# Identification
The board reads "www.MarsBoard.com" on top, and has an A10 SoC clearly visible. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][35518] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _Marsboard_A10_ build target. 
#### Upstream/Mainline U-Boot
Use the _Marsboard_A10_ target for building [mainline U-Boot][35519]. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_marsboard_a10.fex_][35520] file. 
#### Upstream/Mainline kernel
Use the _sun4i-a10-marsboard.dtb_ device-tree binary for the [mainline kernel][35521]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The single button near SATA port triggers [ FEL mode][35522]. 
## JTAG
[This page explains how to attach JTAG to your marsboard.][35523]
## Expansion Headers
Board have 2 x 70 pin [expansion headers][35524]. 
# Adding a serial port

[][35527]
Marsboard A10 UART pads
On the P2 header, pins 64, 65 and 66 are ground, TX and RX, respectively. Attach some 2.0mm pitch leads according to our [UART howto][35528].
