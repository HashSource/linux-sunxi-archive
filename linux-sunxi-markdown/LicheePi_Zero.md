# Identification
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    Lichee
    Zero
[/code]
[code] 
    SUNXI
[/code]
# Sunxi support
## Current status
No sunxi support now, but there's some WIP code. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **LicheePi_Zero_defconfig** (supported since v2017.05) build target. 
~~Not supported yet. WIP code is at[[2]][30974]~~
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun8i-v3s-licheepi-zero.dtb**. 
~~Not supported yet. WIP code is at[[3]][30975]~~
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
When the on-board flash is empty, just remove the MicroSD to enter FEL mode. 
# Adding a serial port
## Locating the UART
The pins tagged "I2C1" on the board is the UART0 (muxed with I2C1). 
When seeing from top and have the "SUNXI" silkscreen at left side, the TX pin is the left (12th pin at the bottom), and the RX is the right (13th pin).

Note: the yellow wire seen on the back image of the sample board is because this board is one of the earliest samples, and the factory made a mistake when soldering the DCDC chip, which needs to be fixed.
