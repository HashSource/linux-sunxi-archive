DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][21564]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
Remove screws from the right side, then pull off the back cover. 
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][21564].
