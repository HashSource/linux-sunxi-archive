# Identification
The board has a Cubietech logo, the names "Cubietech", and "CC-A80", just above the WiFi antenna. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
### Sunxi Kernel
Like all [A80][15130] based devices, there is no support in our sunxi kernel. 
### Sunxi U-Boot
Like all [A80][15130] based devices, there is no support in u-boot-sunxi. 
### Mainline kernel
Mainline kernel support is queued up for 4.2. Currently only MMC and UARTs are supported. 
Use the sun9i-a80-cubieboard4.dtb device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][15154]. 
### Mainline u-boot
Use the _Cubieboard4_defconfig_ build target. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
Follow [SDK build howto][15155] to build u-boot and the kernel from the SDK. 
## Mainline kernel
Initial support for the A80 based on the Cubieboard 4 board is being worked on. 
Use the _sun9i-a80-cubieboard4.dtb_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][15154]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
There is no FEL mode button on this board. 
Instead you can enter fel mode from [U-Boot][15156]. While U-Boot is starting, type CTRL+C to interrupt it. At the prompt type _efex_ to enter fel mode. 
If booting fails entirely then FEL mode can be entered by shorting pin 29-30 on the nand/emmc with a suitable metal object (tweezer or the like), by vendor official procedure. 
# Expansion Ports
The Cubieboard4 board exposes a 2 mm pitch connector for GPIO. 
## GPIO Connector
The pinout is printed on the board:
