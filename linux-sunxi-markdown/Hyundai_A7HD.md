# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    S7-S
    ... With Android
    Designed by Lovendesign in China
    Assembled in China
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    RK-S7S01-V1.2_20120215
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _A7 HD_
  * Build Number: _RKS7S01_A7HD_20120412_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. Touchscreen unknown. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the _hyundai_a7hd_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards under as [hyundai_a7hd.fex][24531]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][24532]. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the sun4i-a10-hyundai-a7hd.dts device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][24533]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
There are 4 buttons on the A7HD, the left one is the powerbutton, and any of the three other buttons can be used to trigger FEL mode, as described in the [FEL mode howto][24534]. 
## Flaky WiFi
The A7HD has a known issue with less than ideal WiFi reception. The fix is to re-route the WiFi antenna, but in order to do that you need to partly disassemble your device and remove the back. 
Further information can be found in [this android forum post][24535]. 
## Powerdown with UART attached
The A7HD suffers from the same problem as other A10 devices. When you power down with the UART still attached, some power continues to flow into the device, and it will not power down properly. So disconnect the UART if you need to do a proper power down. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

A7HD UART pads
## Device disassembly
Carefully insert your [plastic tool][24539] into the long edges, and push the plastic outwards while pushing the aluminium back plate inward, and work the whole 2 long sides. Now insert your plastic tool into the short edge, and push the aluminium backplate outwards. 
## Locating the UART
There are some pre-tinned pads available on the front side of the motherboard, right next to the SoC. All you have to do is attach some wires according to our [UART howto][24540]. Use very thin wires to export this UART, as otherwise you will get pressure points on your LCD and your back cover might not fit properly anymore.
