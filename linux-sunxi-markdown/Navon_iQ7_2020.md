UART pads
Has not been tested yet, should be 3.3V serial UART according to the [UART howto][39162]. You need to remove the board from the housing and peel up the insulating layer from the board to find the exposed GND, TX, RX pads. The VOL+, VOL-, POWER buttons are **separate plastic pieces from the housing** , make sure you don't lose them. The following screws need to be unfastened from the board: one below MIC+ and MIC-, one above the PFF62-10AL 8GB NAND and the one above the CAM connector. The flex cables are held down with black pieces of adhesive you need to pull off carefully. The speaker, battery and wifi antenna are soldered to the board. 
## Device disassembly
Top two screws need to be unfastened and the back needs to be popped off using a guitar pick. Refer to the [ Plastic tool howto][39163].
