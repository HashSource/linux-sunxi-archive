# Identification
The PCB has the following silkscreened on the front:

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Many features (eMMC, USB, Ethernet, GPIO, WiFi(?)) are supported by mainline Linux, but audio and video support are missing (see the H616 column of the [status matrix][50612] for more details). U-Boot support is usable. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][50613] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Vendor U-Boot
<https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/pi-u-boot/tree/v2021.07-sunxi>
#### Mainline U-Boot
LPDDR4 support and AXP313a PMIC support were merged into U-Boot v2024.01-rc3. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Vendor Kernel
<https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/pi-linux/tree/pi-6.1-sunxi>
Use the _sun50i-h618-bananapi-m4berry.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary.
[Patches are available][50614], but untested, so not upstreamed. Please report back to [ Andre][50615] when you have tested these. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The FEL/SW2 button triggers [ FEL mode][50616]. 
## Locating the UART
The UART pins are located near back of right USB ports, in a clearly distinct group of three pins. They are marked as _TX_ , _RX_ and _GND_ on the PCB. Just attach some leads according to our [UART Howto][50617].
