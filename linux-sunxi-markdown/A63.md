# Overview
The A63 is a new tablet processor targeting the low end market. It is another tablet chip with the [ARM64 architecture][3980]. It is now present in some tablets. It is advertised for tablets as 2k display ready. 
This seems to be a pure tablet/phone SoC, **without** Ethernet and HDMI support. Also there is no parallel LCD output or LVDS anymore, instead there is the new eDP output, which is more widely used on modern panels. 
On the software visible side the A63 uses the new H6 memory map, also shares the new clock register scheme. The pin controller and most peripherals and their number seem to be closer to the A64, though. Also there is no USB 3.0 or PCIe. 
According to the manual the "CPUs" management processor is now ARM Cortex-M4 based, instead of the OpenRISC design used in the other recent SoCs.
