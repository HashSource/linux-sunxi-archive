This page needs to be properly filled according to the [New Device Howto][4343] and the [New Device Page guide][4344].
This device was very popular in 2012, and probably saw many different iterations. It is likely that camera and wifi modules, and battery capacity vary wildly. 
The same housing was also sold with a different board inside, namely [the A721][4345].

# Identification
This section explains how to most easily identify your device. For a development board, explain the name(s) printed on the board. For an android device, find out the strings as reported under settings.
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    Manufacturer Marketing Name
    ModelNumber
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    LIA-BB-V6.66
    1970-01-01
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _A710_
  * Build Number: _crane_a710-eng 4.0.3 IML74K eng.liushen.20120209.115637 test-keys_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
No patches provided, no real information on this page. This device is not supported, and needs to be pulled through our [New Device Howto][4343]
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][4365] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][4366]file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][4367]. 
## Touchscreen
To make ft5x touchscreen work with X out of the box you need to disable CONFIG_FT5X0X_MULTITOUCH in drivers/input/touchscreen/ft5x_ts.h and recompile ft5x_ts module. 
If you flash your LY-F1 with firmware from branded clone (Texet, explay, onda & etc.) or vice versa, you will get your FT5X touchscreen EEPROM empty. Log:

This will lead complete zero response from touchscreen. 
Only way to fix this is to flash different firmware to your FT5X. Files and simple .bat script can be found in [this archive][4368]. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
[![][4369]][4370]
[][4371]
DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][4372]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][4373].
Just insert something like plastic card in gap between case and LCD housing - there is no screws. Tablet PCB mounted on LCD housing assembly, backplate is different on OEMs (shape, logos & etc). 
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][4372].
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][4374], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
