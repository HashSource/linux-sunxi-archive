# Identification
This section explains how to most easily identify your device. For a development board, explain the name(s) printed on the board. For an android device, find out the strings as reported under settings.
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    Tablet PC I T74ER
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    AL-AX3-751S_V1.5
    2015.03.23
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _DEVICE_
  * Build Number: _Oysters_T74ER_SA002_08092015_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Mainline U-boot OK from SD. 
Mainline kernel started but usb and drm don't work 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig** build target. 
In new versions of U-Boot, USB-OTG power supply does not work. Use a USB hub with active power supply, or an old U-Boot 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun8i-a33-q8-tablet.dtb** device-tree binary. 
To work with GPU acceleration, apply this old patch. Worked in 2022.

# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The Volume+ button triggers [ FEL mode][43663]. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.

# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
[![][43664]][43665]
[][43666]
DEVICE UART pads
This section explains how to attach a serial port to the device. Make sure it refers to our [UART howto][43667]. For a development board, you can just mention how to find the header with the pins and include a picture, and you can remove the warranty voiding warning.
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][43668].
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][43667].
## Adding USB Host port
This device has an empty USB Host pad near the Wi-Fi chip. Don't forget to enable **CONFIG_USB_EHCI_GENERIC** in u-boot 
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][43669], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
