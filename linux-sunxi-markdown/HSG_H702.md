# Identification
The PCB is clearly marked **HSG_H702_V1.2**. 
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: SoftwinerEVB
  * Build Number: nuclear_evb-eng 4.0.4 IMM76D 20130418test-keys

The android strings are not helpful as both are generic [A13][23630] Allwinner strings. The only option to properly identify this device is by [opening up the case][23647] and reading the markings on the board. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "A13_MID" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [hsg_h702.fex][23652]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][23653]. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the _sun5i-a13-hsg-h702.dts_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][23654]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Volume+ button triggers [ FEL mode][23655]. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

HSG H702 UART pads
## Device disassembly
See [the Q8 tablet format disassembly page][23659]. 
## Locating the UART
On the front of the mainboard, there are two test pads next to the SoC. Solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][23635]. These pads are connected to UART1, and are not multiplexed with the SD card.
