# Identification
The IBOX is easily identifiable by the "IBOX" branding on the side, the aluminium case and high-gloss finish on the top of the case. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
The IBOX is very similar to the [Cubieboard2][28447] and boots most images build for the Cubieboard2 without issues. Images which Itead Studio themselves suggest actually have Cubieboard2 as the board type in u-boot. Thus, support is on-par with the Cubieboard2. 
## Images
Cubieboard2 images will work for this board. Itead lists some images [here][28448]
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][28449] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
Because this device is highly compatible with the [Cubieboard2][28447], you should also be able to get away with using the [Cubieboard2 manual build instructions][28450]. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _Cubieboard2_defconfig_ build target unless _Itead_Ibox_A20_defconfig_ is available. 
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _Cubieboard2_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_iteaduino_plus_a20.fex_][28451] file. 
#### Mainline Kernel
Use the _sun7i-a20-itead-ibox.dtb_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][28452].file. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The **Uboot** button, left of the USB ports, triggers [ FEL mode][28453]. Hold the button in while plugging in power. 
## USB
3 of the 4 USB ports are connected to the outputs of the USB hub IC. However, USB 4 is connected directly to the port and supports USB OTG. Pins 1 and 2 of the expansion header export the same USB OTG port. 
## Power
Power is supplied by an MP2307 switching regulator. Theoretically, you should be able to power this board with 12V (which is more convenient than 9) without issues. The regulator provides a maximum of 3A @ 5V. 
The device will also run if powered over the USB OTG port, which means you can run it from a 5V supply. Be careful as this is not intended operation and there is no protection for over-current, reverse polarity etc. That being said, I've measured a peak draw of about 700-800mA over 5V so a 1A supply should work well. Try this at your own risk - it is a hack. 
## LED/IRDA
The IBOX also has a dual-colour LED (red/green) and in infrared receiver connected to PB4 of the A20. 
## Expansion Header
The 32pin expansion header provides access to 
  * VGA
  * Stereo analogue input/output
  * SATA
  * SPI
  * I2C
  * 4 UARTs (2 dedicated, 2 shared by SPI pins)
  * Duplication of USB port 4
  * Power

# Serial port

Ibox UART pins
## Device disassembly
Board can be disassembled by removing the 4 screws on the bottom of the box. It is intended to be a development platform in a consumer package, so they have not made it difficult. 
## Locating the UART
The UART can be found on pins 9 (TX) and 10 (RX) with ground on pin 29 on the expansion header. Read the [UART howto][28457] for more information.
