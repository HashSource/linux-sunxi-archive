# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    The PCB has the following written on it:
    ET_Q8_A23_A33_v1.6 
    140903
    
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: MID-756
  * Build Number: astar_rda-eng 4.4.2 KVT 49L 20141110 test-keys

# Sunxi support
## Current status
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][17551]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][17552]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
## Mainline kernel
Use the _sun8i-a33-et-q8-v1.6.dts_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][17553]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Volume+ button triggers [ FEL mode][17554]. 
## Retrieving script.bin
Unlike, other allwinner devices,Script.bin is not present in the vfat partition(nanda) as file. 
Instead, It is located 0x43000000, it's size is 0x00020000. script.bin can be extracted from /dev/mem using mmap(). 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
There are no UART pads available on this device. Instead, UART0 is multiplexed with the microSD adapter. Please refer to the [MicroSD Breakout adapter][17555] for more information..
