The A10s-Olinuxino-MICRO is an [A10s][40376] based development board made by [Olimex][40378]. Like all [Olimex hardware][40378], it is fully [Open Source Hardware][40379]. 
Because the [A10s][40376] is no longer actively supported by Allwinner, this board should not be used for new designs or new projects.

# Identification
It says "A10s-OLinuXino-MICRO" on the top. It just doesn't get easier than that! 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "A10s-OLinuXino-Micro" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [a10s-olinuxino-m.fex][40396]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][40397]. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the sun5i-a10s-olinuxino-micro.dts device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][40398]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The BOOT/REC button triggers [ FEL mode][40399]. 
## LCD modules
You can attach [several Olimex LCD modules][40400] to the LCD connector (LCD_CON). 
## Expansion ports
Several expansion options are provided: 
  * [A UEXT connector][40401]. This is meant for attaching [Olimex UEXT modules][40402].
  * A 14 pin IO connector (GPIO-1).
  * A 40 pin IO connector (GPIO-2).
  * A 10 pin IO connector (GPIO-3).

# Adding a serial port

[][40405]
UART connector
There is a 2.54mm pitch connector marked UART0 on the board. All you have to do is connect the leads according to our [UART howto][40406]. The pin identifiers are shown on the bottom side of the board.
