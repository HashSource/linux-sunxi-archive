# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    POINT OF VIEW MOBII icon
    TAB-PROTAB25XXL
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    INET-10F-REV03

  * Model Number: _POV_TAB-PROTAB25XXL_
  * Build Number: _10F2-P1-H1-H01-2911.2012208_

## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][26023] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. --> TODO but inet1 uboot works for now 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][26024]. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
see inet1, they contact pads are not marked rx/tx but are there (3 contact pads ) 
## Device disassembly
By removing the two screws on the connector side, the device is trivially opened. 
## Locating the UART
There are some UART pads next to the wire going to the wifi antenna, all you need to do is solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][26025].
