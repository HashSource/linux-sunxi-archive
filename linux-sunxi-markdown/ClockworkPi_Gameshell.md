# Sunxi support
## Current status
Building and running your own build of u-boot and Linux is currently unsupported. The device seems to be running a custom build of u-boot and Linux version 5.7.0. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi HW-pack specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## BSP
Optional. Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE sunxi BSP specifics here. When empty, this section can be removed.
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][12943] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Only useful for A10/A10s/A13 and A20 based devices. Remove this section otherwise.
Use the [_MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex_][12944] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the patches from <https://github.com/clockworkpi/Kernel> or <https://github.com/wolfallein/clockworkpi-debian/>
_FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. <https://github.com/wolfallein/clockworkpi-debian/blob/master/bin/kernel/5.7/sun8i-r16-clockworkpi-cpi3.dtb> & <https://github.com/wolfallein/clockworkpi-debian/blob/master/bin/kernel/5.7/sun8i-r16-clockworkpi-cpi3-hdmi.dtb>
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][12945]. 
## Device specific topic
If there are no further device specific topics to add, remove these sections.

[][12948]
ClockworkPi UART pads
To use the UART, you can use the pins on the side of the board, follow [Stuarts's guide][12949] or [the post on the forum][12950]. See [UART howto][12951] for generic UART instructions. 
## Device disassembly
If necessary, provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped. If pins do need to be popped, mention the [Plastic tool howto][12952].
## Locating the UART
Describe how to find the RX,TX,GND signals here, and mention the [UART howto][12951].
# Pictures
Take some pictures of your device, [ upload them][12953], and add them here. DO NOT UPLOAD PICTURES WHICH YOU PLUCKED OFF THE INTERNET.
