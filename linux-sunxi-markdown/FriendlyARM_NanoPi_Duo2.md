# Identification
The Duo2 is a small narrow black PCB, densely packed, with "NanoPi Duo2" in very small silkscreen. 
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it:

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported in mainline from 5.5 
## Images
[[FriendlyARM provides linux 4.14 based images][20407]] 
## BSP
FriendlyARM provides both 4.14 and 3.4 legacy trees. 
### 4.14 tree
  * <https://github.com/friendlyarm/linux.git> -b sunxi-4.14.y

### 3.4 tree
There's very little reason to use this tree. The board is supported by 4.14 from FriendlyARM themselves, and in mainline from 5.5. The tree is available at <https://github.com/friendlyarm/h3_lichee.git> with [[| documentation on the FriendlyARM wiki][20408]] 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][20409] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
There's no explicit duo2 support in U-Boot, and it's unclear if that's valuable. The [FriendlyARM_NanoPi_Air][20410] is equivalent for most purposes. Providing a separate name for the duo2 would be a trivial patch if desired. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _sun8i-h3-nanopi-duo2.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Not documented as not considered useful at this stage. 
## FEL mode
No FEL button, the UBOOT pin is pulled up via 10K. 
## LEDS
A red and green led are available. The red is pulled up, and intended as a power indicator. Green is free for use. 
## WIFI/Bluetooth
The [Ampak AP6212][20411] is quite well supported by linux, but it does require suitable firmware files, both for the wifi portion, and the bluetooth portion. 
## Locating the UART
The primary debug uart (uart0) is on the GPIO2 header, at the end nearest the USB connector. There is silk marking RX/TX/Ground.
