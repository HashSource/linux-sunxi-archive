# Identification
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it:

[/code]
The RISC-V version can be identified by the label on the SoC reading "F133-A" (a relabeled D1s), the ARM version reads "T113-S3" on the SoC. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
The ARM version is supported in mainline Linux and U-Boot, the RISC-V version should work in the kernel, given the right devicetree, which is not mainlined. U-Boot support for the D1(s) is still missing in general. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][35065] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _mangopi_mq_r_defconfig_ build target. Available since v2024.01-rc1. 
### Mainline Linux Kernel
Use the _sun8i-t113s-mangopi-mq-r-t113.dtb_ devicetree binary from a mainline kernel, available since v6.5-rc1. 
## Wifi
There is no Wifi driver for the chip in mainline, see [Wifi#RTL8189ES_.2F_RTL8189ETV][35066]
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The board has a FEL button on the underside of the PCB, near the board's edge. The button closer to the SD card slot is the reset button. 
The USB type-C socket labelled "OTG" (next to the antenna connector) is connected to USB controller 0, a standard USB-A - USB-C cable can be used for FEL booting. 
## Serial port
The board has no dedicated UART connector, but has two prominent UART pins on the (unsoldered) in-line header connector. UART0 is available on pins PE2/PE3, the UART3 RX/TX pins are on pins PB6/PB7. While UART0 is the more natural debug console port, the schematic clearly designates UART3 as the debug UART, so the DT and U-Boot's defconfig select this UART and its PB pins for this purpose. 
Please note that the pin names are written _below_ the pins, so the top-most pin is PB4, and UART3 RX/TX are on the third and fourth pin.
