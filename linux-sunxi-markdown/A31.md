# Overview
A31 powered by 4 CPU and 8 GPU (Power VR SGX544 for Ployer and Power VR SGX544MP2 for Onda). 
[![][3166]][3167]

A31 Graph
A31 CPU architecture consists of quad ARM Cortex-A7 cores to deliver decent computing capability while consuming less power, and integrates the PowerVR SGX544 GPU. It also features [Cedar Engine][3169] multimedia processing unit that is capable of up to 2160p (3840x1080@30fps 4k resolution or 1080p 3D decoding) video decoding, with integrated HDMI 1.4 output support, and H.264 HP (High Profile) in 1080p at 30fps video encoding. 
Proper Linux support now difficult for A31 due to the [Power VR][3140] GPU, though; however, its kernel source is available[[1]][3170] now and also for U-boot[[2]][3171]. 
## Cortex-A7
Cortex-A7 is 100% ISA compatible with the Cortex-A15, this includes the new virtualization instructions, integer divide support and 40-bit memory addressing. Any code running on an A15 can run on a Cortex A7, just slower. This is a very important feature as it enables SoC vendors to build chips with both Cortex A7 and Cortex A15 cores, switching between them depending on workload requirements. ARM calls this a big.LITTLE configuration.[[2]][3172][[3]][3173][[4]][3174]
## A31s
The A31s is the same die as the A31 in a different package. In terms of hardware specification and functionality they are identical.

# History
The A31 was initially rumored to be called the A40 instead. On July 9 _[cnbeta.com][3178]_ and _[chinaeshops][3179]_ speculated that the next [SoC][3180] from [Allwinner][3181] will be a Quad-Core Cortex-A7 ARM Processor SoC, and twice as many GPU cores as it has CPU cores, (it was also unclear early on which GPU it would had, and rumors speculated on Mali 450, Mali T604, or Mali T658 GPU). 
"_This new SoC was thus most likely be either called Allwinner A40 if the pictures from iLife Tech banners taken at Hong Kong Electronics Fair 13-16 October 2012 are correct_ ".[[5]][3182]
"_It's look like Veda confirm the rumor with a tablet, Veda X75, which include an A40 (Quad-Core / 8GPU)_ ".[[6]][3183]
Onda V972, a 10-inch Android tablet, was the first device to be publicly announced to come with an Allwinner A31 SoC.[[7]][3184]

# Software
## Original SDKs
We have made some SDKs available on our server: 
  * a31_V4.5_MerriiLinux_Humming ([Full][3191], [Reduced][3192], [Unpacked][3193])
  * a31_hummbingbird_V3.3_v2_kfb_0k ([Full][3194], [Reduced][3195], [Unpacked][3196])

# Owners of the SoC on IRC
bamvor, ojn, drachensun or mripard own an A31-based board. 
# Community Support
There is no support for the A31 and the A31s in u-boot-sunxi and in the linux-sunxi 3.4 kernel, but both [mainline u-boot][3231] and the [ mainline Linux kernel][3232] have basic support for the A31 and A31s (cf. the respective links for further information).
