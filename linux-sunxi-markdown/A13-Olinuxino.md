# Identification
It says "A13-OLinuXino" on the top. It just doesn't get easier than that! 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "A13-OLinuXino" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [a13-olinuxino.fex][1876]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][1877]. 
## Mainline kernel
Use the sun5i-a13-olinuxino.dts device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][1878]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Home button triggers [ FEL mode][1879]. 
## Power Supply Voltage
**Warning, while you can boot this board at 5V it really is preferable to boot this board at 6V.**
For instance, enabling the backlight on the 7" LCD module will immediately hardlock the board at 5V, while at 6V it is perfectly stable. 
## VGA
Even though the [A13][1854] does not provide DACs itself, the A13-Olinuxino has a VGA connector. 
This is implemented through 3 separate DAC chips (NXP LVC244A) which are connected to the LCD0 lines. This in turn means that you cannot use an LCD and a VGA monitor at the same time, but this is ok as the [A13][1854] can only drive one display at a time anyway. 
Due to the bandwidth limitations of the A13 SoC, the best resolution you can hope for is 800x600. 
## LCD modules
You can attach [several Olimex LCD modules][1880] to the [LCD connector (LCD_CON)][1881]. 
## Expansion ports
Several expansion options are provided: 
  * [A UEXT connector][1882]. This is meant for attaching [Olimex UEXT modules][1883].
  * [A 10 pin IO connector (GPIO-1)][1884].
  * [A 40 pin IO connector (GPIO-2)][1885].

# Adding a serial port
[![][1886]][1887]
[][1888]
Revision C and up UART pads
The earlier revisions of the A13-OLinuXino (Revisions A and B) had a separate UART1 connector which shared lines with the SD connector. You had to use the UART lines on the [UEXT connector][1882], to be able to use an SD card as well as serial. 
From revision C onwards, there is the unpopulated UART0 connector, which shares those same lines with the SD Card lines. There is also a populated UART1 connector, which is standalone. 
For a connector pin-out, the easiest way is to refer to the pin descriptions on the back of the board. Simply attach your leads according to our [UART howto][1889].
