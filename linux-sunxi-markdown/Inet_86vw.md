# Identification
## PowerFast
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    PowerFast TCTB-7106DC3g-Plus (South America/Brazil)
[/code]
## PCB
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    INET-86VW-REV06 Zeng-gc 2013-06-21
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: _TCTB-7106DC3g (can vary from country to country)_
  * Build Number: _A13_86VWBC_M705BC_1306135.20130724_

# Sunxi support
## Current status
WORK IN PROGRESS 
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][26583]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][26584]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
For [ building mainline u-boot][26585], use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target. 
## FEL mode
The _Volume +_ button triggers [ FEL mode][26586]. 
## Device disassembly
Carefully insert a small, plastic spatula in the groove, in the opposite side from the _Volume_ buttons. Take care to not damage the case, nor the speaker cables inside. 
## Locating the UART
[File:Product Board.jpg][26587]
UART pads
This one looks straight-forward. _Rx_ and _Tx_ pads are between the processor's enclosure and the mmc/SIM card slot. The _GND_ is just on top of the board, between back camera and board's identification silk screen. Just solder the wires and have a go for it. 
(NOTE: Also has an _Ub001_ pad, don't mess with it!)
