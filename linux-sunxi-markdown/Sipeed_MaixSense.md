# Sunxi support
## Current status
Mainline support is WIP. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][50905] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Still being done. To try out the working-in-progress code, retrieve the code at [[1]][50906] and use the _sipeed_maixsense_defconfig_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Still being done. To try out the working-in-progress code, retrieve the code at [[2]][50907] and use the _sun50i-r329-maixsense.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
By default no SPI Flash is soldered, that means just removing SD card makes the SoC to enter FEL. 
# Adding a serial port
Just plug a cable connected to your PC to the port at the down side (next to the 4-pin connector, which provides another UART, not the debug one). An onboard CH340 USB-UART bridge is available for accessing the debug UART.
