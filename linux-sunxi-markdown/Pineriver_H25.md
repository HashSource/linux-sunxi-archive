## BSP
Add link so people know what to do with this information. configure the BSP using pineriver_h25 
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "pineriver_h25" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [pineriver_h25.fex][45050]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][45051].

UART pads
## Device disassembly
The case has 2 screws which should be removed first. Then use your [Plastic tool][45056] to gently push the back cover outwards to pop the remaining clips. 
## Locating the UART
The UART can be found between the A10s and one of the memory chips. There are 2 sets of pads, one with 4 pins, one with 3. The 3 pins is the UART, with RX, TX and GND from left to right, when the A10s text is best readable. See the [UART howto][45057] for more info.
