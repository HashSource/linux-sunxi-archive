# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    The PCB has the following written on it:
    GPT
    A33_Q7_V1.0
    20016-09-19
    1.91.001.0181
    
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: Q88H
  * Build Number: astar_y3-eng 4.4.2 KVT49L 20161110 test-keys

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Mainline U-boot OK from SD **but not support DSI LCD**. 
Mainline Kernel OK from SD **but not support DSI LCD**. 
## Images
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig target.

  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][3617]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][3618]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
Use 2016.11 with default A33 1024x600. 
**q8_a33_tablet_1024x600_defconfig** file 
## Mainline kernel
Use the _sun8i-a33-et-q8.dts_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][3619]. With USB host mode only work with every type of cables. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Volume+ button triggers [ FEL mode][3620]. 
## Retrieving script.bin
Unlike, other allwinner devices,Script.bin is not present in the vfat partition(nanda) as file. 
Instead, It is located 0x43000000, it's size is 0x00020000. _script.bin_ can be extracted from /dev/mem using mmap() or sunxi-tools _firmware_extractor_. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
There are no UART pads available on this device. Instead, UART0 is multiplexed with the microSD adapter. Please refer to the [MicroSD Breakout adapter][3621] for more information.. 
## Device disassembly
See [the Q8 tablet format disassembly page][3622].
