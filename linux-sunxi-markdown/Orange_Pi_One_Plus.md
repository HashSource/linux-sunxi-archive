_The Orange Pi One Plus is a 64-bit_[H6][42633] _based single board computer by[Xunlong][42636]._
The Orange Pi One Plus is an upgrade from the previous [Orange Pi One][42637]. It uses the new Allwinner [H6][42633] SoC. In comparison to Orange Pi One, this board has Quad Core Arm Cortex-A53 cpu. The SoC also has 4k capabilities at 60fps due to it's Mali T720 GPU. 
In comparison to DDR3 RAM present in most SBCs, the One Plus uses 1GiB of LPDDR3 RAM. The board has 1 USB 2.0 port, Gigabit Ethernet, Pi Compatible GPIO header, OTG, etc. 
The [H6][42633] support USB 3.0 but the board doesn't got it implemented. However, it's cousin, [Orange Pi Lite 2][42638] have one.

# Identification
_The One Plus has a black-colored pcb, different from it's[older brother][42637]._
On the top of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    Orange Pi
    ONE PLUS
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it:

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported in both mainline U-Boot and Linux. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][42655] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **orangepi_one_plus_defconfig** (supported since v2018.09) build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_orangepi_one_plus.fex_][42656] file. This was extracted from the android sdcard image. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun50i-h6-orangepi-one-plus.dtb** device-tree binary. 
# Expansion Port
The Orange Pi One Plus has a 26-pin, 0.1" connector with several low-speed interfaces. To learn about accessing the GPIO pins through sysfs with mainline kernel read [GPIO][42657]

# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
Booting without an SD card automagically enters FEL mode. 
[code] 
    ./sunxi-fel version
    AWUSBFEX soc=00001728(H6) 00000001 ver=0001 44 08 scratchpad=00027e00 00000000 00000000
[/code]
The H6 UBOOT pin is routed to test-point TP28 on the PCB. 
# Adding a serial port
[![Orange Pi One Plus UART pins][42658]][42659]
This device has a three pin UART header as shown in the picture. On the underside of the board, TX, RX, and GND are marked. Wires should be attached as described [Here][42660]
