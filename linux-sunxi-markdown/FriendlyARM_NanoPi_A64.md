# Identification
There is a label on top of the Ethernet port with a QR code and "NanoPi-A64" written on it. Also on the SoC there is a quite prominent "A64" print. 
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    FRIENDLYARM
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it:

# Sunxi support
## Current status
From the software point of view this device is similar to the [Pine64][20072] (similar DRAM, same Ethernet and PMIC), so basic support _should_ work with some Pine64 image _if_ PMIC configuration is identical (at least according to [this review][20073] Pine64 images don't even boot). 
## BSP
FriendlyARM provides an adopted BSP [on Github][20074]
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][20075] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **nanopi_a64_defconfig** build target (supported since v2017.09). 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun50i-a64-nanopi-a64.dtb** device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
There is no FEL button on this board. Booting without an SD card automagically enters FEL mode. 
## USB OTG
A64's USB OTG port is exposed as Type A receptacle and the Micro USB jack is for powering only (exactly identical with [Pine64][20072]). 
## Powering the board
A battery connector has been saved so the only way to power the board is with 5V through GPIO headers (either 40 pin or the 4 pin debug header) or the Micro USB jack. In case you use the latter please keep in mind that a lot of stability/boot problems are related to [Micro USB being the wrong choice for DC-IN][20076]. At least the Micro USB cable FriendlyARM ships with the device is of good quality (low resistance). 
## ESD & over-current protections
Based on the schematic Rev 1610 (December 15, 2016) the board incorporates the following protections: 
Protections x - no protection, ESD - Electrostatic Discharge, OC - Over-current  | Comments   
---|---  
1 | USB micro (power) | x | x | Power supply bypass.   
2 | Micro SD | x | x |   
4 | Camera | x | x |   
5 | Display | x | x |   
6 | Dual USB | ESD | x | Power supply bypass.   
7 | HDMI | ESD | x |   
8 | Ethernet | x | N/A | Over-current protection is not applicable.   
9 | GPIO | x | x | Only UART2 & UART3 have ESD protection.   
10 | Debug UART | ESD | OC | Current is limited by using resistors.   
11 | Audio jack | ESD | N/A | Output current is internally limited by SoC.   
# Serial port / UART
[![][20077]][20078]
[][20079]
NanoPi A64 UART headers
The board exposes 2 UART ports trough the GPIO header and the UART0 port on a separate 4 pin header 
UART2 uses pins 11 (TX), 22 (RX) and UART3 uses pins 8 (TX), 10 (RX). 
All of the UARTs use 3.3V voltage levels. Look at our [UART howto][20080] for further instructions. 
## Locating the UART
Below the GPIO there is a separate 4 pin header with "DBG_UART" silkscreened next to it, in the bottom of the board the labels "RX", "TX", "5V", "GND" can be found next to the corresponding pins.
