# Sunxi support
## Current status
There currently is no support for this board. There are other H8 devices supported, so support may be possible. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][31556] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Unsupported. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Unsupported. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Unsupported. 
#### Mainline kernel
Unsupported. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## CPU Heating issues
The A83/H8 absolutely needs a heatsink, active cooling is heavily recommended, otherwise the CPU will lower max frequency or even stop using cores. 
## FEL mode
The UBOOT button triggers [ FEL mode][31557]. 
## Arduino Compatability
pcDuino8 Uno is pin to pin compatible with Arduino so that existing Arduino shields can be installed on pcDuino and many Arduino libraries can run in pcDuino programming environment. 
# Adding a serial port
## Locating the UART
The pcDuino8 Uno provides access two of the H8's UARTs. See the [UART howto][31558] for more details. 
The 3-pin header labelled "UART" sticking out from the side of the board is the H8's UART0. Pin 1 (with a square pad, closest to the uSD slot) is TX, pin 2 is ground, pin 3 is RX. 
UART3 is available on the Arduino connectors. UART3 is in the standard place for an Arduino UART.

## Manufacturer images
The [Ubuntu 14 image that LinkSprite provides][31572] uses a modified linux-sunxi 3.4.39 kernel. Their patches and build scripts are available [on GitHub][31570]. 
There is also a [Ubuntu 14 image bundled with OpenCV][31573]. 
Also available is an [Android 4.4 image provided by LinkSprite][31574].
