# Identification
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: MID
  * Build Number: K100C-L1-D35-20130920

# Sunxi support
## Current status
  * Basic u-boot and kernel works.
  * The LVDS panel works if a clock is added in fex file.
  * Touch chip (focaltech ft0402) is initialized and i2c irq seems to work, but no valid data is present. With evtest garbage data appears when touching screen, but no valid coordinates.

## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "K1001L1C" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [k1001l1c.fex][27465]

Everything else is the same as the [ Manual build howto][27466]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The back button triggers [ FEL mode][27467].

UART pads
## LVDS panel
TODO.
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
## Device disassembly
Remove the 2 screws on the connector side. The screen edge extends beyond the connectors, and with the device lying on its display, gently push the outer rim out with your [plastic tool][27471]. You will soon hear the clamps pop. 
## Locating the UART
There are clearly labeled pads, on the top left edge, near the camera, you just need to solder on some wires. For more info, refer to the [UART howto][27472].
