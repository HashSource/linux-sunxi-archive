### E1220 UltraStick
This mobile modem is available as an SPCI module, which is a new formfactor which Huawei seems to be pioneering. 
SPCI is Smart Personal Computer Interface, but it is marketed as "UltraStick" by Huawei. SPCI is basically a connector with USB2.0, PCM (for audio) and some extra power handling. It allows for both data and voice mobile communication. More information about this format is available in [this datasheet][38406].
