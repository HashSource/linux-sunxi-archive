Biqu CB1 is a H616 based board in Raspi Compute Module form factor, requires an extension board to drive(power, GPIO, ports .etc). 
This page needs to be properly filled according to the [New Device Howto][10004] and the [New Device Page guide][10005].
If a device is special, then feel free to provide a terse description of what makes this device so special. But terse, no novels, no marketing blurb.

## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][10018] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
Use the _h616_defconfig_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
WIP 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
WIP 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Could not yet figure out how to boot the board in FEL mode 
## UART
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
Adding UART is very simple. All pins are already on the board. Just need to be soldered to. They are located on top of the board near the H616 SoC
