# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    ainol
    3G AW1
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    NOVO-707FC-A1_V02_13073100
    
[/code]
In Android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: Numy_3G_AW1
  * Build Number: 20130924

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported, but lacks [ mainline kernel support][6136], and some features are missing under our [ sunxi kernel][6135]. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][6147] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _Ainol_AW1"_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _Ainol_AW1_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [_ainol_aw1.fex_][6148] file. 
Some features are missing on [Linux (sunxi-3.4 branch)][6149]: 
  * USB OTG doesn't work on the external connector (common to all sun7i devices) and it doesn't seem to work in either host or device mode
  * Wi-Fi support is not there but external patches are available (it segfaults as-is)
  * Touchscreen support is not there but external patches are available (untested)

#### Mainline kernel
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
Any button (VOL-, VOL+, HOME) triggers [ FEL mode][6150] from boot1. 
Sending '2' over UART at boot triggers [ FEL mode][6150] from boot1. 
## SPCI slot / 3G Modem
The device has a SPCI modem connector that allows connecting a specifically designed 3G/4G/Voice module. An example of such a modem is [ the Huawei E1220][6125], which sometimes gets sold with this tablet. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

Ainol AW1 UART pads
## Device disassembly
The plastic back case is very easy to open. There are no screws but only a few clips that are easy to pop: you probably don't even need a [plastic tool][6154] for this. 
Once the PCB is exposed, there are 4 Philips screws to remove on the lower part of the PCB. You must also remove the LCD/touchscreen connections by lifting up the black parts on the connectors and releasing the flexible flat cable, on the top-right part of the PCB. At this point, you should be able to flip the PCB to the right, exposing its back. 
A black isolant sticker covers the back of the PCB: remove it for now but don't forget to **put it back later** , as it isolates the many test pins from the conductive surface of the back of the screen! 
## Locating the UART
Locate the UART on the back of the PCB according to the pinout and just solder on some wires according to our [UART howto][6155].
