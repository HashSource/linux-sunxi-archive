# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed, along with a serial number and mac address: 
[code] 
    Model: TX6S-H
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    CS_H616_TX6S_B4_V3.0
    20191218
[/code]
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model: _TX6s_
  * Kernel version: _4.9.170 #10 Tue Dec 15:15:02 CST 2020_
  * Build: _cupid_p1-userdebug 10 QP1A.191105.004 eng.hanxia. 20201219.091846 test-keys_

# General Notes
The device is shipped with an eMMC with Android installed 
I have uploaded console logs to capture the starting point with this board.

# Sunxi support
## Current status
The basis of the H616 SoC mainline effort has been included in 5.12. Preliminary Linux and Trusted Firmware patches are available and are in the process of being mainlined. H616 U-Boot support has been merged into v2021.04. The Tanix TX6s is not yet included in current 5.12 kernel. The sun50i-h616-tanix-tx6s.dts and tanix_tx6s_defconfig are in the process of being upstreamed. 
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][54478] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **tanix_tx6s_defconfig** build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the **sun50i-h616-tanix-tx6s.dtb** device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
The PCB is mounted upside down in the case, so the connectors are all flipped over (USB, SD card, HDMI, Ethernet). 
## FEL mode
Left of the SD-card slot, there is a button (barely) visible through the ventilation slots. It triggers [ FEL mode][54479] mode when held down while resetting or powering up. On the PCB this button is not marked (there is another button not marked between SPDIF and the 2 USB 2.0 on the back). You will need a USB-A <-> USB-A cable for FEL mode.

## Device specific topic
This device uses DDR3L (not LPDDR3) memory! 
Device is also equipped with 4-digit 7-segment display, driven by FD650B-S chip.

## Device disassembly
[![][54481]][54482]
[][54483]
Tanix TX6s remove top lid
There are no screws holding the plastic lid in place. 
To open the box, Gently slide a [plastic tool][54484] or a knife in the small gap around all edges of the box to eventually lift the top plate, releasing 9 plastic tabs in the holding the cover. I started on the front, and then with a little leverage (in the front centre) was able to disengage the clips on the sides, and finally the back. 
To remove the PCB, remove the 3 screws, then lift the side with the 7 segment display up, then gently pull this side the PCB up. This is allow you to then remove the PCB - the backside connectors somewhat protude into the backside of the case. 
## Locating the UART
[![][54485]][54486]

Tanix TX6s UART pads
[![][54488]][54489]
[][54490]
Tanix TX6s UART pads pcb v4.1
The UART pads are located beside the USB port on the side of board. They are marked as _TX_ , _RX_ and _GND_ on the PCB. Just attach some leads according to the [UART Howto][54491]. Speed is 152000.

# Also known as
There is also the [TX6][54508] TV box, sometimes selling alongside the TX6s. It uses the H6 Allwinner chip versus the H616 Allwinner chip.
