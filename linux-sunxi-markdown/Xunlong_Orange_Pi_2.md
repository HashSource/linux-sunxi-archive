_Orange Pi 2_ is [H3][60387] based development board produced by [Xunlong][60389]. The concept is based on the original [Orange Pi][60390]. Both, Orange Pi 2 and its smaller cousin [Orange Pi Mini 2][60391] (similar to [Orange Pi Mini][60392]) were released in March 2015. The board is based on a quad-core [H3][60387] CPU, and offers a TF card slot, onboard Ethernet (10/100M Ethernet RJ45) and WiFi (802.11 b/g/n), 40 pin GPIO and 4 x USB type A connectors, but does not come with the SATA port like the [A20][60393] based original [Orange Pi][60390] did.

# Identification

# Sunxi support
## Current status
The H3 SoC support has matured since its introduction in kernel 4.2. Most of the board functionality for boards such as Orange Pi 2 are available with current mainline kernels. Some features (hw accelerated crypto, hw spinlocks, and thermal) are still being worked on. For a more comprehensive list of supported features, see the [status matrix for mainline kernels][60413]. In addition, legacy 3.4 kernels are available in various work-in-progress git branches. 
See the [Manual build][60397] section for more details. 
  

## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [Manual build howto][60414] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the **orangepi_2** (supported since v2016.05) build target. The U-Boot repository and toolchain is described in the [Mainline U-Boot howto][60415]. 
The H3 boards can boot from [SD cards][60416], [eMMC][60417], [NAND][60418] or [SPI NOR][60419] flash (if available), and via [FEL][60420] using the OTG USB port. In U-Boot, loading the kernel is also supported from USB or ethernet (netboot). HDMI support in U-Boot is still WIP. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
The 3.4 kernel from the official [Allwinner's git repository][60421] [does not support H3][60422] yet. But it is possible to use one of the kernel forks, based on the [lichee H3 SDK tarball][60423]: 
  * [Siarhei Siamashka's branch '20151207-embedded-lima-memtester-h3'][60424]
  * [Yann Dirson's fork][60425] added a few more fixes and adopted most of
  * [Boris Lovosevic' great initial work][60426] on Allwinner's H3 kernel

Configure this kernel using **sun8i_h3_defconfig** , the rest is explained in the [kernel compilation guide][60427]. 
Use the .fex file for generating [script.bin][60428]. The .fex file can be found here for now [orangepi2.fex][60429]. This was extracted from the android sdcard image. 
When booting the legacy 3.4 kernel with the mainline U-Boot, add the following line to boot.cmd: 
[code] 
      setenv machid 1029
      setenv bootm_boot_mode sec
    
[/code]
Some other legacy kernel repositories: 
  * [3.4-lichee-based kernel][60430], based on work by [ssvb][60431] and [loboris][60432]
  * [Yocto support here][60433] glues together all the required parts to get this kernel to work with mainline u-boot, as well as accelerated X11/GLES support
  * [A newer H3 BSP variant][60434] appeared with tons of fixes which has been made available by FriendlyARM.
  * [A cleaned up fork][60435] has been adopted by Armbian project. On top of that Armbian maintains a bunch of [3.4.x patches for H3 devices][60436].

#### Mainline kernel
The mainline kernel has good support for the H3 SoC. Please refer to the [status matrix][60437] for a more detailed list of the development process, links to patches and links to kernel fork repositories. Minor drivers that are currently work-in-progress may require a) [third party patches][60438] (see also arm-linux mailing list) or b) a pre-patched distro (e.g. [Armbian][60439]). 
Repositories with H3 patches: 
  * [Ond≈ôej Jirman's branch for H3 based orange Pi (kernel 4.19)][60440] (work-in-progress DVFS) 
    * Thermal regulation (if CPU heats above certain temperature, it will try to cool itself down by reducing CPU frequency)
    * HDMI audio support (from Jernej Skrabec)
    * Configure on-board micro-switches to perform system power off function
    * Wireguard (<https://www.wireguard.com/>)
  * [Philipp Rossak's THS patches (in the sunxi-ths- branches)][60441]
  * [Corentin Labbe's HW Crypto and spinlock patches (in respective branches)][60442]

  
Use the **sun8i-h3-orangepi-2.dtb** device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The button marked _SW3_ , located between the HDMI and TTL UART, triggers [ FEL mode][60443] when pressed during boot. 
To [ verify][60444] you have successfully entered FEL mode, check the output of `fel version`. For the Orange Pi 2, it should look like: 
[code] 
    AWUSBFEX soc=00001680(unknown) 00000001 ver=0001 44 08 scratchpad=00007e00 00000000 00000000
[/code]
## LEDs
For those with a transparent case (or no case at all) the Orange Pi 2's LED activity is good. The **red** power LED (_D7_) can be turned off. 
## Expansion Ports
The Orange Pi 2 exposes a 2.54mm pitch connector.

UART pads
## Locating the UART
The UART pins are located on J3 between DC input and Uboot Button(SW3) of the board. They are marked as _TX_ , _RX_ and _GND_ on the PCB. Just attach some leads according to our [UART Howto][60476].
