# Sunxi support
## Current status
All Hardware working, in android system, but no luck so far with U-Boot I manage barely to load some bare metal assembly codes to turn on the lcd backlight and blink the charging led using bit banging i2c to the Power controller AXP209 but nothing else. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][28539] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Sunxi/Legacy Kernel
Use the [[1]][28540] file. 
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _Allwinner A13_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The Vol_Up + Power button triggers [ FEL mode][28541]. here is how: connect the usb to the pc make sure your android is totally shut down (vol_down + power for 10 to 15 sec) hold Vol_Up + Power Button for 2 to 3 sec while still holding Vol_Up release power button then tap power button 3 to 4 times until you see the ask for permission to connect on your computer 
## Getting the script.bin
the script.bin is not easy to obtain using FEL mode but you can access it thru ADB by getting nanda image and unpack it using this command: adb pull /dev/block/nanda ./nanda.img 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)

UART pads
## Device disassembly
no screws for this device just use the plastic sharp wedge from the side to open the back cover. take care of the speaker which may be attached to the back cover, so do not pull hard and try to get the speaker from the cover slowly. 
## Locating the UART
I do not use UART and not recommended using it anyway but if necessary you can use the SD-Card Pins thru a converter. this is the safest way and avoiding soldering on the board.
