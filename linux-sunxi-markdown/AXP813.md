## Overview
AXP813 is a high integrated power management and audio Codec integrated circuit available in 11mm x 11mm 218-ball BGA package. The device contains power management, audio codec, USB3.0-compatible Flash Charger, real-time clock (RTC), analog to digital converter (ADC) and hardware DSP. 
The power portion of AXP813 targets at Li-battery (Li-ion or Li-polymer) applications that require multi-channel power conversion outputs. It provides an easy and flexible power management solution for multi-core processors to meet the increasingly complex and accurate requirements on power control. 
The devicecomes with an adaptive USB3.0-compatible Flash Charger that supports up to 2.8A charge current. It also supports 21 channels power outputs (including 7-CH Bucks). To ensure the security and stability of the power system, the device provides multiple channels 12-bit ADC for voltage/current/temperature monitor and integrates protection circuits such as OVP, UVP, OTP and OCP. Moreover, the device features a unique E-Gauge™ system, making power gauge easy and exact. 
A fast interface is included to dynamically adjust output voltage and set the work mode so that the battery life can be extended to the largest extent. Other features combined with an IPS™ (Intelligent Power Select) circuit to transparently select the type of charger and provide charging with USB chargers, external AC chargers, and Li-battery. 
The audio codec of the device includes three I2S/PCM interfaces to provide independent and fully asynchronous connection to multiple processors, five analog input paths to allow diverse analog audio sources such as microphone, baseband voice, FM radio, etc., and five differential or single-ended output paths to be used in headphone amplifiers, speakers and baseband voice, etc. Meanwhile, the integrated hardware DSP engine capable of AGC and DRC, which can respectively be used in record and playback paths for maintaining a constant signal level and maximizing the loudness. 
In addition, the device has a RTC, it can be powered by a backup battery when the main supply is not present. 
AXP813 is extremely diverse on tablets, smart phones and mobile application platforms.
