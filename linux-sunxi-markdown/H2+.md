Allwinner H3 (sun8iw7p1) SoC features a Quad-Core Cortex-A7 ARM CPU, and a [Mali400][22407] MP2 GPU from ARM. The Allwinner H3 is a highly cost-efficient quad-core OTT box processor, primarily marketed as being for "home entertainment" systems. 
It has a nearly-compatible variant known now, H2+. 
**It's rated to run at 1.296GHz, anything higher is overclocking (and usually overvolting). If you run it without heatsink, fan and proper dvfs settings, you risk overheating.**

# Variants
H2+ is a variant of H3, targeted at low-end OTT boxes, which lacks Gigabit MAC and 4K HDMI output support. 
H3 images are proven to run on H2+. 
According to the source code of BSP[[1]][22431], variants differ by the last byte of the first word of SID. 0x42 and 0x83 indicates H2+, 0x00 and 0x81 indicates H3, and 0x58 indicates H3D (a still unknown variant).

# Software
## U-Boot
### Allwinner
### Mainline U-Boot
Starting with version 2016.01, the official [mainline U-Boot][22428] has supported the H3 SoC and various boards with it. This is the recommended way of booting boards when not using BSP kernels. 
U-Boot defconfigs still missing for these H3 boards: 
[code] 
    * Orange Pi Mini 2 (as a workaround, please use orangepi_2 defconfig)
    * Orange Pi Plus 2 (as a workaround, please use orangepi_plus defconfig)
    * pcDuino4 Nano (as a workaround, please use orangepi_one defconfig)
    
[/code]
## Kernel code
### Allwinner
### Sunxi Community
The mainline Linux kernel supports the H3 SoC quite well. For a more comprehensive list of supported features, see the [status matrix for mainline kernels][22448]. 
Device tree configs still missing for these H3 boards: 
[code] 
    * Orange Pi Mini 2 (as a workaround, please use sun8i-h3-orangepi-2.dtb)
    * Orange Pi Plus 2 (as a workaround, please use sun8i-h3-orangepi-plus.dtb)
    * pcDuino4 Nano (as a workaround, please use sun8i-h3-orangepi-one.dtb)
    
[/code]
