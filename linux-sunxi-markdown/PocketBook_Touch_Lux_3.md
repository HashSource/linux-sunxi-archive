# Identification
On the back of the device, the following is printed: 
[code] 
    PocketBook Touch Lux 3
[/code]
The PCB has the following silkscreened on it: 
[code] 
    IDIG E028 PB626 V1.6
    20141229
[/code]
PocketBook manufactured on 20/08/2018 has this silkscreened on the PCB 
[code] 
    XRZ_E028 PB626-V2.1
    20170406
[/code]
Most notable change is usage of 8GB eMMC storage on the new board and Elan touch screen. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
  * Full mainline/linux/u-boot support for all HW (with some extra out-of-tree patches), including a kernel driver for controlling the eInk display via DEBE/TCON0 with an ability to precisely time the ink manipulation down to multiples of 50ns. The driver can achieve full speed (85Hz) communication with the display. Interface is via writing a framebuffer to a special character device /dev/eink-panel.

### TODO
  * The display driver is now mature enough to allow for easy experimentation with the display.
  * Instead of pushing all the complexity of parsing waveform data and figuring out what to do to move the ink from a current position to a new one to kernel space, the driver provides the base interface for writing a precisely timed frame to the display. Waveform parsing, temperature adjustment of timings, and choosing an algorithm to update different regions of the display is left to the userspace, where it can be much more easily experimented with and used to provide the best experience based on what content is displayed in what regions of the screen.
  * Waveforms for the display are stored on the SPI NOR flash, analyze the format to see how the timings are specified. 
    * Waveforms can be read using <https://github.com/fread-ink/inkwave>, precise meaning of data stored therein is still unclear, though
  * Re-check USB0, if perhaps it can support at least a forced host mode. (would need a VBUS switch)
  * Reduce data copying by using memory mapped buffers. (this can save ~ 800us)
  * Allow to interleave submission of a next buffer and processing of the current one (submission takes ~8ms with all the scheduling, copying and conversion of FB data to display control stream). This would allow for going from 50Hz update rate to ~100Hz
  * Write a tool to manage transitions between different display states using NEON intrinsics.

## Images
Pre-built kernel/u-boot available at <https://xff.cz/kernels>
## BSP
  * <https://github.com/pocketbook/Platform_A13> (does not contain code for all drivers, code for cyttsp4.ko, epdc.ko is missing)

## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][45404] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Sunxi/Legacy U-Boot
No u-boot code is available from the manufacturer. 
#### Mainline U-Boot
Not yet upstreamed, but patches are available here for now: 
  * <https://xff.cz/git/u-boot/log/?h=opi-v2019.10>

Use the _pocketbook_touch_lux_3_defconfig_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
The board support is mostly upstreamed, except for touchscreen patches and the display support. Non-upstreamed changes are in this branch: 
  * <https://xff.cz/git/linux/log/?h=pb-5.9>

Use the _sun5i-a13-pocketbook-touch-lux-3.dtb_ device-tree binary and _pocketbook_touch_lux_3_defconfig_ config. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
  * You can buy any variant of ED060XD4 display for Touch Lux 3, replacement requires some care not to break anything. The display is glued to the plastic frame with an double-sided adhesive tape. It's possible to separate the display from the frame by sticking some flat sharp plastic tool between the display and the frame from the front side. I used an old credit card. The trick is to try to swipe the card along all edges of the display, while laying it mostly flat on the display. You can replace the display without glueing the new one in.
  * There are three variants of the display available: just the eInk display (matte or gloss) (~$13-15), eInk+backlight (~$25), eInk+backlight+touch digitizer (~$50-65). Some manufacturers claim on Aliexpress that they provide the panels for PocketBook and that their displays are matte and have even backlight. I can confirm that. I also confirmed that using the cheapest $13 replacement display without backlight also works. (original firmware has trouble booting when touch panel digitizer is not detected, so using a cheap display is adviseable if you don't want to use the original firmware)
  * After installing the new display, touchscreen may be acting weirdly. That may not mean it's broken, it may just need calibration. Calibration is performed by writing a bunch of values to bunch of registers. Nothing special. There's a confusingly named S06-xc4_calibrate.sh script in the original firmware's boot partition that can be used to do calibration with the original kernel. I plan to add support for calibration to the mainline driver.
  * I doubt it's possible to replace backlight cable without breaking the connector. The connector is extremely fragile. I used thermal glue pistol to fix the new cable in place but it's still easy to cause shorts and shutdown the regulator, just by pressing device buttons or by pressing on the back cover. Thankfully the PMIC is resilient and will only shut down the backlight regulator if it detects the short-circuit. Regulator can be restarted by disabling/enabling the backlight in sysfs.

## ED060XD4 eInk display
This display is sold in 3 variants on the internet. Just eInk display panel, + backlight, + backlight and touch.

    FFP pinout: (reverse engieneered)
    ---------------------------------
    It turns out that ED060XD4 has the same interface as ED060XC5 or ED060XC3 (Touch Lux 2).
    
    The datasheet for ED060XC5 is available on the internet. It looks like ED060XG1 has also
    the same interface and its datasheet contains extra timing/interface
    information, that can be useful.

    Driving the display
    -------------------
    
    Display power up needs to be sequenced:
    
    - VDD rail (V3P3 switch must be enabled over I2C)
    - 4 "High" voltage rails (default sequencing in the PMIC is good enough)
    - VCOM
    
    At the begining both SPV and SPH are high, the rest is low.
    
    Frame signals timing:
    
    - MODE1 high for the duration of the frame (no CKV clk is sent without MODE1 being high)
    - 5 CKV pulses after mode high
      - SPV goes low during the high state of the 2nd CKV pulse
      - SPV goes high during the high state of the 3nd CKV pulse
    - during the high state of 6th CKV pulse, row data start being shifted in:
    
    (a)
      - CKV goes high
      - SPH goes low
      - row data shifted in (CKV goes low in 3/4 of the data shift)
      - SPH goes high and OE goes low
      - ~2us
      - LE goes high
      - OE goes high
      - LE goes low
      - CKV goes high
      - go to (a) for a next row or (b) at the end of a frame
    
    (b) 
      - end of frame
      - wait for the duration of row data cycle (last row needs to be applied)
        - CKV goes low (3/4 to the end)
      - OE goes low
      - MODE1 goes low
    
    Frame frequency can be up to 85Hz.

CKH is missing, but it's just a boring 20MHz square clock signal. 
# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
  * UART has nice big pads on the side of the board, easy to solder some wires to
  * pads are clearly marked
  * 3.3V

## Device disassembly
Front panel contains hooks that unlock when sticking sharp tool in between it and the back panel. Avoid bottom side of the device when opening, as it contains vulnerable cables and electronics. The back panel pops out almost too easily.
