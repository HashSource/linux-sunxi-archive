# HW Register Tools
To help with debugging registers in Allwinner SoCs and related chips (like PMICs, codecs, etc.), you can use tools and register definitions found here: <https://megous.com/git/sunxi-registers/>
  * You can dump registers
  * You can generate C header files

The repository contains register definition files for various Allwinner related chips. Feel free to contribute more. 
See the README (<https://megous.com/git/sunxi-registers/about/>) inside the repository for more information.
