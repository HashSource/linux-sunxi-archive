This page needs to be properly filled according to the [New Device Howto][23747] and the [New Device Page guide][23748].
If a device is special, then feel free to provide a terse description of what makes this device so special. But terse, no novels, no marketing blurb.

# Sunxi support
## Current status
Unsupported. 
However, as of this writing, the sun8i-h3-orangepi-pc target is generic enough to be safely usable with this device. 
Since this is not a developer device, things like missing mainline [H3][23743] support for ethernet, HDMI/Composite out and only one active USB port does limit its current usefulness. 
  

## Images
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific sunxi ROM images here. E.g. a livesuit image or some other linux image which uses linux-sunxi code. Do not put non-sunxi images here, they should live under [See also][23767]. If no sunxi based images are available, this section can be left blank.
## HW-Pack
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE HW-pack specifics here. This section can be left blank.
## BSP
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE BSP specifics here. This section can be left blank.
## Manual build
  * For building U-Boot, use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [hyh-tbh3.fex][23769]

Everything else is the same as the [manual build howto][23770]. 
## Mainline U-Boot
If there is mainline U-Boot support, add this section.
For [ building mainline U-Boot][23771], use the _MANUFACTURER_DEVICE_ target. 
Don't forget to add 
[code]
    [[Category:Mainline_U-Boot]]
[/code]
at the bottom of the page.
## Mainline kernel
If there is mainline kernel support, add this section.
Use the _FAMILY-CHIP-DEVICE.dtb_ device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][23772]. 
Don't forget to add

# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
Add MANUFACTURER DEVICE specific tips, tricks, Caveats and nice to have changes here.
## FEL mode
Make sure that your device is **truly powered off**. Do not leave any cables attached. Attach The [UART][23773] cable and launch your serial console. Now in the same time you attach the Power cable and you send the character '2' to the device during power-up. When in fel mode you should see **eraly jump fel** on screen. Now you can attach a USB-cable to the USB port near the micro SD slot. 
To [ verify][23774] you have successfully entered FEL mode, check the output of `sunxi-fel version`. For the Hyh-tbh3, it should look like: 
[code] 
    AWUSBFEX soc=00001680(H3) 00000001 ver=0001 44 08 scratchpad=00007e00 00000000 00000000
[/code]
## DRAM clock speed limit
DRAM is clocked at **672 MHz** by the hardware vendor. But the reliability still needs to be verified. One of the ways of doing reliability tests may be <https://github.com/ssvb/lima-memtester/releases/tag/20151207-orange-pi-pc-fel-test> (it checks the Orange Pi PC DRAM setup in the current mainline U-Boot v2016.01-rc2 + [a bugfix][23775]). 
NOTE: While this test image was made for the Orange Pi PC, it also runs on the Orange Pi Plus.

DEVICE UART pads
  

## Device disassembly
Remove the four rubber feet on the bottom and unscrew the four micro screws, see [Device_picture][23781]
## Locating the UART
UART pads are located between the USB port and the A/V CVBS output jack [UART howto][23773].
