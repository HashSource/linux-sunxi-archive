# Sunxi support
## Current status
Supported. 
  * Mainline kernel patches posted to linux-sunxi mailing list 2025-01-02
  * Mainline u-boot patches posted to u-boot mailing list 2025-06-07

## Manual build
You can build things for yourself by following our [ Manual build howto][39352] and by choosing from the configurations available below. 
### U-Boot
#### Mainline U-Boot
Use the _sun8i_v3s_netcube_kumquat_ build target. 
### Linux Kernel
#### Mainline kernel
Use the _sun8i-v3s-netcube-kumquat.dtb_ device-tree binary. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
If not eMMC or SD-Card is connected, shorting pins 4 and 6 on the SPI-NOR chip triggers [ FEL mode][39353]. 
# Adding a serial port
[![][39354]][39355]
[][39356]
Console connector
There is a secondary USB-C connector located on the right half of the device,  
connected to an CH340 USB-Serial converted which is then connected to UART0.  
Connect a USB cable to it and your computer and then the UART can be access as described in [UART howto][39357].
