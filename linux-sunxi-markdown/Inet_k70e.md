# Identification
In android, under Settings->About Tablet, you will find: 
  * Model Number: JDQ39  WTF, this is the id string for Android 4.2.2
  * Build Number: wing_ibt-eng 4.2.2 JDQ39

# Sunxi support
## Current status
No sunxi-boards or u-boot-sunxi patches have been made available yet, but this can be trivially done following the [New Device howto][27526]. Touchscreen doesn't work yet, but apparently ft5x_ts.c can be hacked to make it work. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
  * For building u-boot, use the "MANUFACTURER_DEVICE" target.
  * The .fex file can be found in sunxi-boards as [MANUFACTURER_DEVICE.fex][27543]

Everything else is the same as the [ Manual build howto][27544]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
The something button triggers [ FEL mode][27545].

# Adding a serial port (**voids warranty**)
[![Exclamation-red.png][27549]][27550] **WARNING: Do not attach VCC like the person who made this picture. This might harm your device.**
## Disassembling the device
Provide a short description of how to open the device. Perhaps explain how the pins can be most easily popped.
## Locating the UART
There are 2 pads labelled "RX" and "TX" between the SoC area and the GSM/GPRS module. You can get Ground from anywhere else on the board. All you have to do is follow the [ UART howto][27551] to solder on some wires.
