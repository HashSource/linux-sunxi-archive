# Identification
The board has a clearly recognizable Allwinner logo, the name "Allwinner Tech", and "OPTIMUS BOARD", all uppercase, in the lower right hand corner. 
# Sunxi support
## Current status
### Sunxi Kernel
Like all [A80][37661] based devices, there is no support in our sunxi kernel. 
### Sunxi U-Boot
Like all [A80][37661] based devices, there is no support in u-boot-sunxi. 
### Mainline kernel
Mainline kernel support is queued up for 3.19. Currently only UARTs are supported. 
Use the sun9i-a80-optimus.dtb device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][37686]. 
### Mainline u-boot
Like all [A80][37661] based devices, there is no support in mainline u-boot. 
## Images
## HW-Pack
## BSP
## Manual build
Follow [SDK build howto][37687] to build u-boot and the kernel from the SDK. 
## Mainline kernel
Initial support for the A80 based on the A80 Optimus board is being worked on. 
Use the sun9i-a80-optimus.dtb device-tree file for the [mainline kernel][37686]. 
# Tips, Tricks, Caveats
## FEL mode
There is no FEL mode button on this board. 
Instead you can enter fel mode from [U-Boot][37688]. While U-Boot is starting, type CTRL+C to interrupt it. At the prompt type _efex_ to enter fel mode. 
If booting fails entirely then FEL mode can be entered by shorting pin 29-30 on the nand/emmc with a suitable metal object (tweezer or the like), by vendor official procedure. 
# Expansion Ports
The A80 Optimus board exposes a 2 mm pitch connector for GPIO, and a Camera/MIPI connector [connector details needed].
